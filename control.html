<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I have shown that a basic bicycle model can exhibit stability when linearized
about the nominal configuration for a range of speeds, Chapter <a class="reference internal" href="eom.html#eom"><em>Bicycle Equations Of Motion</em></a>.
Stability is a strong function of the parameters of the bicycle and it turns
out that standard bicycle designs, typically exhibit a speed dependent
stability and the bicycle becomes stable at some speed threshold, Chapter
<a class="reference internal" href="parameterstudy.html#parameterstudy"><em>Parameter Studies</em></a>. Based on the damping of the weave mode, one may also
even claim that the bicycle becomes <em>more</em> stable as speed increases,
neglecting the very slow, easily controllable capsize instability. I&#8217;ve also
shown that stability can be enhanced or decreased by extending the Whipple
model with a flywheel or rider degrees of freedom, Chapter <a class="reference internal" href="extensions.html#extensions"><em>Extensions of the Whipple Model</em></a>.
In Chapter <a class="reference internal" href="motioncapture.html#motioncapture"><em>Motion Capture</em></a>, I&#8217;ve examined the kinematics of the rider to
see if the rider&#8217;s motion during a control task has any correlation to the
kinematics of the Whipple model and identified the dominant rider motions
during stabilization.</p>
<p>As far as roll stability is concerned, it is highly probable that a human must
implement active control at <em>all</em> times while balancing. I conclude this because
the bicycle&#8217;s roll angle responds to the human&#8217;s postural control. But the
stability exhibited of the almost-always-present weave mode may alleviate the
need for primary roll control provided by the rider. And even if the
bicycle-rider system is open loop unstable at a given speed, the question
arises of <em>how</em> instable is it or <em>how</em> controllable is it. Classic
controllability is simply a binary test to determine whether or not it is
possible for a system to be controlled, whereas there must be some measure
variable measure of controllability that is more relevant to the proposed
questions. <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#seffen2001">[SPC01]</a> studies how parameter changes affect
controllability, and comes up with rideability index. <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#schwab2010a">[SK10a]</a> and
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#schwab2012">[SMK12]</a> also determine the controllability of several bicycle
models and uses modal controllability as a continuous measure of the
controllability. The pole locations of an open loop system can also give a
general sense of the degree of its controllability, with roots in the far right
plane likely being difficult to stabilize.</p>
<p>One can work with different bicycle models (simple/complex [or low/high order]
and linear/non-linear), different control structures, and different ways to
identify the optimal numerical values for the controller. For a given order
model, most control structures allow one to place the closed loop poles in the
desired location. Controllers designed for low order or linear models are even
likely to work with higher order models and non-linear models. But the control
structure design provides different views into the feedback mechanisms at work.
For the human controller, these structures may or may not correspond well to
the human&#8217;s physiological and neurological system. The human has to choose his
control actions to balance the requirements for robustness and performance.</p>
<p>The bicycle-rider system presents both a theoretical and experimentally rich
dynamical system for control studies. It is very tractable in the sense that
most people are familiar with controlling a bicycle and that it is a <em>simple</em>
machine which is readily available for experimental use. Additionally, control
of the bicycle is not necessarily trivial due to it&#8217;s complex dynamics and thus
it provides a good platform for testing many control strategies. Past control
studies tend to be framed in two different but overlapping frameworks. The
first is to simply control a bicycle (model or real) with any control
algorithms and mechanisms available. Both the simple roll stabilization task
and more complex path tracking tasks have been examined. The results show that
bicycles are readily controllable by a variety of means, from a simple steer in
the direction of the rate of fall to full state feedback with preview of future
path variations. Depending on the sensing and actuation methods chosen these
controllers range in their resemblance to how a human may actually control a
bicycle. This leads into a second framework in which the researcher is
explicitly trying to determine the how a human balances and controls a bicycle.
Basic understanding of the limited sensory input and actuation available to a
human give constraints on what control structures are adopted. Both frameworks
are motivated by many things such as a desire to implement automatic control,
improving simulation for vehicle design, handling qualities inquiries, control
system testing, etc.</p>
<p>The intention of the work presented in this dissertation falls in the second
framework, where we are most concerned with identifying the human controller.
The first part of this chapter gives an overview of other non-human based
single track vehicle control efforts, followed by some simple control examples.
I follow this with a review on human based control design and finish up with
some addendum material to our paper <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#hess2012">[HMH12]</a> which details the
controller design we developed to represent the human.</p>

<h2>Ideal Control Models<a class="headerlink" href="#ideal-control-models" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Many studies exist on the control of a single track vehicles. The following
provides a light review of much of the literature which focus on <em>ideal</em>
controllers for single track vehicles. Here I use the word ideal to simply
label control design which is not explicitly focused on the human operator
control. I&#8217;ve split the review of control models into two sections. The first
are about controllers which have actually been implemented, or attempted to be
implemented, on robotic vehicles. The second are theoretic controllers that
weren&#8217;t necessarily introduced to identify the human control system. The
following section details efforts that explicitly concern controllers that
mimic or try to understand the human controller.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="#figpubs"><em>Figure 10.1</em></a> shows a histogram by year of the all the references
I&#8217;ve collected in the course of this project. It is interesting to note the
explosion in the early seventies that probably coincides with the bicycle boom
and the digital computer age. We&#8217;ve also had a boom in the last decade, with
research interests growing. This may coincide with the microcontroller advances
and potentially some from the growth in bicycling.</p>

<dd>van Zytveld was one of the first to explore the automatic stabilization of
the single track vehicle that was not explicitly in the human control
framework, although he did chose feedback variables that he believed a human
rider could sense. He attempted to control a robot bicycle with only a
leaning rider (inverted pendulum) through proportional and derivative
feedback of rider lean angle and bicycle roll angle. He made use of a linear
model with a rider lean degree of freedom which is fundamentally the same as
the one presented in Chapter <a class="reference internal" href="extensions.html#extensions"><em>Extensions of the Whipple Model</em></a>. His controller worked on
paper, but he wasn&#8217;t able to ever balance the robot bicycle, with the
suspected problems being the limitations of the hardware he used.</dd>
<dt><a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#nagai1983">[Nag83]</a></dt>
<dd>They constructed a robot bicycle which balanced and tracked itself by
feeding back lateral deviation at a previewed time and the current roll
angle. He was successful at stabilizing his robot. The bicycle model was
much simpler than the Whipple model but it gave good agreement between
experiment and the model predictions, with the exception of counter-steer
predictions.</dd>
<dt><a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#ruijs1985">[RP85]</a>, <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#ruijs1986">[RP86]</a></dt>
<dd>Ruijs and Pacejka developed a robotic motorcycle to study the effect of road
irregularities (i.e. cat eyes), is this dangerous. The experiments were
thought to be to dangerous for a human rider thus the robot was developed.
They used a simple control scheme based on gain scheduling as a function of
speed. Below the weave speed was lean rate was fed back and above the weave
speed lean angle was fed back. Additionally, little bit of steer damping was
included. The machine worked as was able to maintain stability during the
experiments.</dd>
<dt><a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#berriah1999">[BL99]</a></dt>
<dd>They developed a digital fuzzy controller to stabilize a remote controlled
bicycle robot. They do not seem to demonstrate the robot actually balancing,
but only bench tests of the sensors and actuators.</dd>

<dd>He designed a robot balancing bicycle which controls a gimbaled gyroscope to

<dd>These papers, among others, detail work on a Honda motorcycle robot, with
the controller modeled after a human. The video demonstrations of this
vehicle indicate that it may be the most manually realistically controlled
robot there is, not to mention that it seems to work really well. Most of
these papers are in Japanese and I&#8217;ve had trouble finding others, so I
cannot comment on all the details.</dd>

<dd>They successfully balances a bicycle on rollers with a PD roll angle to
steer angle controller with a disturbance observer.</dd>
<dt><a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#iuchi2005">[INM05]</a></dt>
<dd>They use PD control on the bicycle roll angle to control steer angle and
rider lean angle. The controller is implemented on a bicycle robot, which is
able to balance on rollers.</dd>
<dt><a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#iuchi2006">[IM06]</a></dt>
<dd>They use the same model base as <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#iuchi2005">[INM05]</a> except they now add a human
torque estimator, so that the controller will not treat the human&#8217;s applied
steer torque as a disturbance if the controller is activated while a rider
is also trying to control the bicycle. They show some crude experimental
results, which I assume are of a rider controlling the bicycle with and
without the automatic controller activated. Their human torque accounting is
based on an estimation of the human torque from the steer motor torque,
rather than explicitly measuring the human&#8217;s torque input.</dd>
<dt><a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#yamakita2006">[YUS06]</a></dt>
<dd>They implement a controller modified from the one presented in
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#yamakita2005">[YU05]</a> with an additional <span class="math">\(H_\infty\)</span> controller. They
show successful roll stabilization of a robot scooter in which they only
implement the roll stabilization control.</dd>
<dt><a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#murata2009">[Mur09]</a></dt>
<dd>The Murata Manufacturing company designed a bicycle robot to demonstrate the
utility of their sensors which debuted in 2006 <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#murata2009">[Mur09]</a>. There is
little published detail on the control techniques but they seem to primarily
make use of a roll rate gyro with steering and a gyro actuator. They also
have other sensors such as ultrasonic sensors for obstacle detection. They
demonstrate stability at zero speed, reverse and forward speeds, stopping
for obstacles, and tracking a narrow s-curve in their video material. There
are no published papers detailing the control system.</dd>

<dd>They use the same vehicle and control model as in <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#yamakita2006">[YUS06]</a> and a new
two degree of freedom &#8220;rider&#8221; pendulum. They demonstrate roll stability of
the robot at exactly zero forward and speeds up to 2 m/s.</dd>
<dt><a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#thanh2008">[TP08]</a></dt>
<dd>Thanh designs a controller with <span class="math">\(H_2/H_\infty\)</span> techniques and applies
it successfully to a bicycle robot which uses a flywheel for stabilization.
He compares it to a PD controller and a genetic algorithm and shows that it
is more robust.</dd>
<dt><a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#mutsaerts2010">[Mut10]</a></dt>
<dd>Mutsaerts designed a Lego NXT bicycle robot with a simple proportional steer
into the direction of roll rate controller and <a class="reference external" href="http://youtu.be/VxiOy4QzD7I">demonstrated</a> bicycle roll stability in crude turns and
straight ahead running.</dd>
<dt><a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#bicyrobo2011">[Bic11]</a></dt>
<dd>In 2011 the first <a class="reference external" href="http://bicyrobo.ait.ac.th/">BicyRobo Thailand student competition</a> occurred and many videos on the internet
demonstrate the successful design of some teams. The full-size bicycle
robots have roll stability and even path following. One video demonstrates
students riding the robot bicycle and simultaneously applying manual steer
torques.</dd>

<dd>The videos <a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mT3vfSQePcs">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mT3vfSQePcs</a> and

mini robot bicycle that is similar in nature to the <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#berriah1999">[BL99]</a>
design with remote control. He uses a commercially available bipedal robot
seated on a small bicycle. A gyro detects the roll rate and he uses a PID
controller to apply the correct steering for roll stabilization. Remote
control is employed to control the heading.</dd>

<p>The limited success of most of the bicycle robots demonstrates that the actual
implementation of single track vehicle control is not trivial. Some robots
could demonstrate basic roll stability and some are even capable of path
tracking but many didn&#8217;t quite work either. The Murata Boy robot is impressive
in its abilities but it uses control outside of what humans are capable of. The
motorcycle robot by Kageyama et al. is probably the most successful
demonstration of a full sized vehicle with control of only steering. The
vehicle dynamic models and control methodologies are varied, implying that many
techniques may be applicable.</p>

also include a preview model of which the tight control needs 2.5s of
preview and the loose control needs at least 12.5 s. It is interesting to
note that he found little change in computed gains for 20% variations in the
various model parameters, leading him to conclude that the rider would be

the motorcycle with the addition of rider lean torque control. He says that
the objective was to develop a control scheme that <em>somewhat</em> represents a
rider and which is simple and effective. His controller inputs are the rider&#8217;s
upper-body absolute and relative lean angles and the path tracking error. He
claims that riders control the motorcycle at the weave frequency at high
speeds. He is able to successfully stabilize and track a path and determine
optimal preview gains. He also finds that the rider lean torque control is

<dd>Sharp applies his LQR based preview model control model from <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#sharp2007">[Sha07a]</a> to
the benchmark bicycle. His findings are somewhat similar. His bicycle model
is 6th order (he includes heading and path deviation) and he sets up the
optimal control problem on full state feedback including varying numbers of
path preview points. The bicycle tracks a path well and he shows high,
medium, and low authority control by changing the LQR weightings. In general
the bicycle roll angle and rate gains are the largest, with rider lean gains
following, and steer related gains being the smallest. His leaning rider is
initially stabilized by a passive spring and damper, and he finds that the
lean torque control is minor when paired with steer torque control. Lean
torque alone requires very high gains.</dd>

<h2>Basic Control<a class="headerlink" href="#basic-control" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It turns out that the Whipple bicycle model can be stabilized with simple
feedback of roll angle or roll rate, with the combination of both working in
most cases. <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#mutsaerts2010">[Mut10]</a> in fact demonstrates the simple roll rate feedback
stabilization with a small robotic bicycle. But these are not necessarily good
controllers, and certainly not controllers which mimic the human. Regardless,
their simplicity allows one to  demonstrate some of the interesting system
dynamics. Take for example Charlie riding on the Rigidcl bicycle at 7 m/s. The
linear Whipple model about the nominal configuration gives the steer torque and
roll torque inputs to roll and steer angle outputs transfer functions as</p>

<p>The denominators of the transfer functions show that we have three stable
modes, as expected. The numerators are potentially more interesting. Note that
the steer torque to steer angle and the roll torque to steer angle transfer
functions both have a single right half plane zero. This single right half
plane zero means that the steer angle response from either input will exhibit
an initial undershoot for a given steer torque input <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#hoagg2007">[HB07]</a>. This
phenomenon can be demonstrated by examining the step response of the two
transfer functions with right half plane zeros <a class="reference internal" href="#figstablestepresponse"><em>Figure
10.2</em></a>.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="figstablestepresponse">

</div>
<p>As expected we see initial undershoot in the steer angle for both cases. In
this case, the initial undershoot initially departs in the asymptotic
direction, but reverses and settles to a negative steer angle. This is easily
demonstrated on a real bicycle by placing one&#8217;s flat open palms on the
handlebar grips. By applying a torque intending to turn the handlebars in the
positive direction, the handlebars initially go in the correct direction, but
once the frame rolls in the negative direction, the steering angle reverses and
puts the bicycle into a steady turn in the negative direction.</p>
<p>If we examine the change in the transfer function zeros as a function of
forward speed <a class="reference internal" href="#figzerowrtspeed"><em>Figure 10.3</em></a>, we see that both the steer
angle transfer functions in Equation <a href="#equation-eqExampleBicycleTransferFunctions">(1)</a>
always have a right half plane zero. And for
<span class="math">\(\frac{\delta}{T_\delta}(s)\)</span>, the zeros do not change with respect to
speed. It is also interesting to note that below about 2 m/s the roll torque to
roll angle transfer function has a right half plane zero. For roll torque, this
would mean that at low speeds a positive roll torque step input (e.g. a gust of
wind<a class="footnote-reference" href="#wind" id="id95">[1]</a>) would cause a positive roll angle initial overshoot with the
roll angle settling to a negative value at steady state<a class="footnote-reference" href="#wind2" id="id96">[2]</a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="counter-steering">
<h3>Counter Steering<a class="headerlink" href="#counter-steering" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Countersteering is the colloquial term used to describe the non-minimum phase
behavior demonstrated in the previous section. Motorcycle driving instructors
are keenly aware of this and teach their students to steer into the obstacle
that they want to go around.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#limebeer2006">[LS06]</a> and <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#sharp2008a">[Sha08]</a> explain that the term
countersteering is used for two potentially conflicting ideas. They examine the
effects of the right half plane zero of a simplified point mass model in much
the same way as <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#astrom2005">[ASKL05]</a>. Sharp and Limebeer show that both the steer
torque to steer angle and steer torque to lateral deviation have right half
plane zeros and Åström develops a <em>steer angle</em> to roll angle transfer function
that has a right half plane zero. The Whipple model matches the
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#limebeer2006">[LS06]</a> interpretation, i.e. that the right half plane zero is in
the steer torque to steer angle transfer function.</p>
<p>The first and most common definition of countersteer is:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>To initiate a turn, steer torque is applied in the opposite direction you
want to turn which then causes the steer angle to initially depart in the
opposite direction of the turn, but after the vehicle rolls the steer angle
reverses into the direction of the turn.</div></blockquote>
<p>The second definition, also clarified by <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#cossalter2007">[CLP07]</a>, regards the sign of
the steer torque in steady turns:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>The applied steer torque may reverse sign with respect to the steer angle to
maintain steady turn. This is generally true at high speeds.</div></blockquote>
<p>The step response to steer torque at a stable speed shows that for a given roll
angle departure the natural stability enforces that steer angle must initially
depart in the opposite direction, <a class="reference internal" href="#figstablestepresponse"><em>Figure 10.2</em></a>. In
the case of roll torque input, a positive roll torque causes a positive roll
angle but an initially negative steer angle. Afterwards the bicycle settles
into a positive steady turn with respect to yaw. For the steer torque input, a
positive steer torque causes an initially positive steer angle which in turn
cause a negative roll angle. The bicycle settles into a negative steady turn.</p>
<p>To see this phenomenon outside of the stable speed range some form of control
is needed to make simulations stable. Below the weave critical speed, the
bicycle can generally be stabilized by a simple feedback gain on roll rate.
Note that this gain must be negative, giving positive feedback. This implies
that we apply steer torque in the same sense as the rate of fall<a class="footnote-reference" href="#negativegain" id="id103">[3]</a>. <a class="reference internal" href="#figweavestepresponse"><em>Figure 10.4</em></a> shows the response
to a commanded steer torque below the weave speed under simple control. The
countersteering in the steer angle is evident.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="figweavestepresponse">

weave speed. The gain is set to -5. Generated by <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">src/control/control.m</span></tt>.</p>
</div>
<p>And above the capsize critical speed, the bicycle can be stabilized by a simple
feedback gain on roll angle which also must be negative. <a class="reference internal" href="#figcapsizeresponse"><em>Figure
10.5</em></a> shows the countering steering required above the
stable speed range.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="figcapsizeresponse">

capsize speed. The gain is set to -10.1. Generated by
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">src/control/control.m</span></tt>.</p>
</div>
<p>For steer torque control inputs countersteering amounts to this: to get the
bicycle into a positive turn, one must initially apply a negative steer
torque to cause an initially negative steer angle and a positive roll angle.
The steer angle exhibits initial undershoot due to the right half plane zero
and settles to a positive angle at steady state. This is the case for at least
all speeds above very slow speeds where the steer torque to roll angle transfer
function has a right half plane zero.</p>

<h2>Human Operator Control<a class="headerlink" href="#human-operator-control" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are few studies focusing explicitly on human control of a bicycle

<h3>van Lunteren and Stassen<a class="headerlink" href="#van-lunteren-and-stassen" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>van Lunteren and Stassen did some the earliest work on the subject at Delft
University of Technology. They were primarily interested in identifying the
human control system in the bicycle riding task. Their studies spanned several
years in the late 60&#8217;s and early 70&#8217;s. <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#lunteren1967">[VLS67]</a>,

<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#stassen1973">[SVLB+73]</a>, <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#lunteren1973">[VLS73]</a> uses a bicycle roll angle feedback
with PID control that drives the rider&#8217;s lean angle and steer angle. The
bicycle model they employ is quite simple (it models their simulator more than
a real bicycle) and does not exhibit proper coupling in steer and roll. The
model also utilizes angle inputs as opposed to input torques. Their control
structure was chosen in part because of equipment limitations but they cite
recent manual control models <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#mcruer1967">[MGK67a]</a> as being preferable.
Nonetheless the research was ground breaking at the time and quite impressive,
with real time system identification in a manually controlled electromechanical
system. They concluded using roll angle input was more reflexive and that the
control using steer angle was more cerebral based on identified time delays.
They further developed their system to include a visual tracking outer loop.
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#lange2011">[DL11]</a> develops a more up-to-date model with the same type of
structure as van Lunteren and Stassen, in which he feeds back roll angle and steer
angle, and drives steer torque with PID controllers. He also points out a sign
error in van Lunteren and Stassen&#8217;s work.</p>

choosing the inputs to be torques and cite the Delft group&#8217;s misguided
assumptions. They design a PID controller with time delays for both steer
torque and rider lean torque control to stabilize the inner roll loop. The
outer loops consist of the previewed error in the desired path at several
future time steps. This error is weighted to calculate a cumulative error which
is then multiplied by a gain to compute an adjustment to the commanded roll
angle. They show simulations of both good roll stabilization and slalom path
tracking which they compare to video footage of an actual bicycle rider.</p>

<h3>Weir and Zellner<a class="headerlink" href="#weir-and-zellner" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Weir worked with McRuer on some manual control papers prior to his PhD thesis
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#weir1972">[Wei72]</a>, where he employed the crossover model together with a
motorcycle model which is based on Sharp&#8217;s early motorcycle model
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#sharp1971">[Sha71]</a> to evaluate the controller used by humans. This is the first
complete attempt at analyzing the rider-motorcycle control system. Weir
determined that roll angle feedback combined with a basic human model and a
simple gain controlling steer torque was the most descriptive control
mechanism. In particular, he showed how steer angle control was poor and he
even examined rider lean angle control using a pseudo rider lean model similar
to <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#hess2012">[HMH12]</a>. Rider lean could successfully control the system, but
required large lean angles. He also worked with multiple loop closures and
found that roll angle fed back to control steer torque, with heading and
lateral deviation fed back to control rider lean angle presented the best
control strategy for the human rider. He only did his studies at a single high
speed with a motorcycle model which only required stabilization of the capsize
mode. It is highly likely that these control strategies could vary with speed,
especially at low speed where the weave mode is the dominant instability. Weir
and Zellner went on to complete several more important studies involving manual
control of the motorcycle <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#weir1978">[WZ78]</a>, <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#weir1979">[WZ79]</a>, including a

thanks to Google&#8217;s book scanning endeavors and Jim Papadopoulos&#8217;s persistence

to the Weir studies, not only because of the speed and vehicle differences, but
because it is examined from the view of a psychologist. We engineers are quick
to model the human sensory and actuation system, with little understanding of
the intricacies of the human brain. Doyle&#8217;s treatise gives a refreshing look
from outside the engineering box. Doyle&#8217;s control model is fundamentally a
sequential loop closure with the inner most loop being roll control and the
outer two being heading and path deviation. He says that the outer loops are
highly dependent on the inner loop. For the inner loop he determines that
continuously feeding back both roll acceleration, with integral and
proportional gains adjusted by the human as the crossover model dictates, will
stabilize the bicycle at non-intended roll angles. To control roll angle, he
claims that we do not do this in a continuous way but rather that we apply
discrete pulses when the roll angle meets a threshold. The continuous portion
of this model has similar form to the one developed by Weir which in turn
resembles our model detailed in the next section.</p>

finds that the critical feedback variables for a stable model were roll angle,
roll rate, steering rate, and the integral of the steer angle, claiming the

<h3>Conclusion<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A single track vehicle can be stabilized and controlled by a variety of means.
Controllers based on simplified dynamical models can potentially control more
advanced linear and nonlinear models and/or real systems (i.e. steer into the
fall). The roll stabilization is the critical task, as path following can&#8217;t
occur without roll control authority. Few people have demonstrated robust
control of a <em>real</em> system which stabilizes in roll at a variety of speeds. Even
fewer have added path tracking abilities. It doesn&#8217;t seem like anyone has
stabilized a robotic bicycle with a controller that has the limitations of a
human built in.</p>

<h2>Hess Manual Control Model<a class="headerlink" href="#hess-manual-control-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Many control model architectures can be used to attempt to identify the human
control system while riding the bicycle. We are limited by the type of sensory
information a human rider can sense, the human&#8217;s processing delays, and the
bandwidth and physical limitations of the human&#8217;s actuators. The human operator
has been modeled with simple models like the crossover model, to more complex
neuromuscular dynamics, and even fuzzy and optimal control; <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#hess1997">[Hes97]</a>
provides a good overview. Some of the controllers are essentially equivalent
placing the closed loop poles in the same place, but make use of different
techniques to get to the end result. <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#lange2011">[DL11]</a> notes that all feedback
controllers can be mapped to a common structure. The models may also be
different in complexity. But in general, finding the simplest mathematical
model capable of capturing the desired dynamics is a good goal. With this in
mind, my advisor Ron Hess developed a controller based on the Whipple bicycle
model and his previous successful multi-loop human operator models. We present
the control model and the loop closure procedure for selecting the five model
gains in <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#hess2012">[HMH12]</a>. This model is fundamentally similar in nature to
Weir&#8217;s work and is built on the same foundations such as that of McRuer et al.
(<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#mcruer1967">[MGK67a]</a> <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#mcruer1967a">[MGK67b]</a>). We similarly found steer angle based
control to be troublesome and had success across a broad range of speeds and
selection of bicycles with steer torque control. We also employed a similar
method of evaluating rider lean control without introducing an extra degree of
freedom. It also resembles the work of <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#doyle1987">[Doy87]</a> with the inner loop
structure dedicated to roll stabilization and the outer loops to high cognitive
control in heading and path tracking.</p>
<div class="section" id="basics-of-manual-control-theory">
<h3>Basics of manual control theory<a class="headerlink" href="#basics-of-manual-control-theory" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Manual control, or human operator control, was primarily birthed from control
engineers after World War II. The requirements for machine designs in which
humans were the principal control element, such as artillery guns and aircraft,
led to human control modeling. Work by <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#tustin1947">[Tus47]</a> theorized early on
that human control systems could be modeled similarly to automatic feedback
systems. Tustin&#8217;s work was followed by years of theoretical and experimental
work by McRuer and his group to understand the control system of aircraft
pilots.</p>
<p>McRuer&#8217;s group found out that humans adjust their control such that the
combined human and plant dynamics behave with desirable closed loop dynamics in
many types of tracking tasks. This phenomenon can be captured by a variety of
theoretical control structures from simple dynamics to complex neuromuscular
models <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#hess1997">[Hes97]</a>. Fortunately, the simpler models can often capture much
of the essential dynamics in human-machine systems such as our bicycle-rider
system. In particular, we make use of the crossover model <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#mcruer1974">[MK74]</a> to
structure our controller design. The reason for this is multi-fold. It allows
us to use a simple system which has been applied to numerous man-machine
systems with good results.</p>
<p>The basic idea of the crossover model is that, when the human is paired with
the plant which she is trying to control, the combined open loop transfer
function conforms to the dictates of a sound control system design around the
crossover frequency <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#hess1997">[Hes97]</a>. The form of this transfer function for
many control tasks remarkably takes the form</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-crossover">
<span class="eqno">(6)</span>\[G_{human}G_{plant}(s) = \frac{\omega_c e^{-\tau_e s}}{s}\]</div>
<p>The model is governed by only two parameters: the cross over frequency,
<span class="math">\(\omega_c\)</span> and the effective time delay, <span class="math">\(\tau_e\)</span>. The simplicity
of this model and its ability to describe many human in the loop systems is
what makes it so powerful.</p>
<p>The model is capable of describing the dynamics of the human at various
crossover frequencies and various performance levels. The majority of the
model&#8217;s experimental validation efforts have been based around laboratory and
vehicle control tasks where good performance was required (i.e. skilled
subjects).</p>
<p>We also focus only on compensatory control structures where the human closes
loops based on output error. This is a simplification as humans are also able
to to take advantage of pursuit and preview based control.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="model-description">
<h3>Model Description<a class="headerlink" href="#model-description" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The control structure was designed to meet these requirements:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Roll stabilization is the primary task, with path following in the outer
loops. The system should be stable in roll before closing the path following loops.</li>
<li>The input to the bicycle and rider biomechanic model is steer torque.</li>
<li>The neuromuscular mode of the closed system should have a natural frequency
around 10 rad/s to match laboratory tracking tasks of a human operator.</li>
<li>The system should be simple. In our case only simple gains are needed to
stabilize the system and close all the loops.</li>
<li>We should see evidence of the crossover model in the open loop roll,
heading, and lateral deviation loops.</li>
</ol>
<p>The multi-loop model we use is constructed with a sequential loop closure
technique that sets the model up to follow the dictates of the crossover model.
The three inner loops manage the roll stabilization task and the outer two
loops manage the path following. We include a simple second order model of the
human&#8217;s open-loop neuromuscular dynamics which produces a steer torque from the
steer angle error.</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-eqNeuromuscular">
<span class="eqno">(7)</span>\[G_{nm}(s) = \frac{\omega_{nm}^2}{s^2 + 2\zeta_{nm}\omega_{nm}s + \omega_{nm}^2}\]</div>
<p>The neuromuscular parameters, <span class="math">\(\zeta_{nm}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\omega_{nm}\)</span>, were
chosen as 0.707 and 30 rad/s, respectively, such that the innermost loops gave
a typical response for a human operator.</p>
<p>The bicycle is modeled using the Whipple model linearized about the nominal
configuration with the primary control input being steer torque. The inner
loops are closed with sequential gains starting with the proprioceptive steer
angle loop, followed by the vestibular roll rate loop, and the visual roll
angle loop<a class="footnote-reference" href="#blind" id="id148">[4]</a>, <a class="reference internal" href="#figinnerloops"><em>Figure 10.6</em></a>. The steer angle loop
in essence captures the force/feel or haptic feedback we use while interacting
with the handlebars. The need for this loop is readily apparent when trying to
control a bicycle simulation with a joystick or steering wheel with no haptic
feedback as demonstrated in <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#lange2011">[DL11]</a>; the difficultly level is high without
it. We found that this proprioceptive loop was essential for stabilization and
closed loop performance, unlike typical aircraft control models. The outer
loops are also visual: heading and lateral path deviation, <a class="reference internal" href="#figouterloops"><em>Figure
10.7</em></a>.</p>

</div>
<p>The control structure is simply a function of five gains, which the human
&#8220;chooses&#8221; such that the dictates of the crossover model are met to get good
overall system performance. The two inner-most loop gains are chosen such that
all of the oscillatory roots of the roll rate closed loop have at least a 0.15
damping ratio. The three outer loop gains are chosen such that the
system has a -20 dB slope around crossover. The crossover frequencies are
selected sequentially such that the next is half the value of the previous.</p>
<p>Traditionally, sequential loop closure methods are performed on a case by case
basis and involve some subjectiveness in applying the design rules of thumb.
This is time consuming and error prone when you have to find the gains for many
systems such as our bicycles and riders at various speeds. The technique
described in <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#hess2012">[HMH12]</a> can be automated to alleviate this. The following
gives the details for developing the gain selection routine.</p>
<p>The roll angle closed loop should be stable, as stability in roll is critical
for the path tracking in the outer two loops. To get there, the closure of the
proprioceptive and vestibular loops must push the poles to a favorable spot for
application of the crossover model on the roll angle loop. To do this, the
first two loop closures require that all of the oscillatory modes have a minimum
damping ratio of 0.15 and natural frequency around 10 rad/s. We first use
the proprioceptive gain, <span class="math">\(k_\delta\)</span> to push the poles originating at the
bicycle weave eigenvalue to a higher frequency with about 0.55 damping ratio.
The choice of this gain is somewhat arbitrary, but it needs to set the weave
mode pole such that it has a small enough damping ratio to allow the roll rate
loop to further push it to a damping ratio of 0.15. In <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#hess2012">[HMH12]</a> we make both
loops have a 0.15 damping ratio, but that is not necessary and may not be what
the human does. The closed loop transfer function for the steer loop is</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-eqDeltaLoop">
<span class="eqno">(8)</span>\[G_{\delta c}(s) = \frac{\delta}{\delta_c}(s) =
\frac{G_{\delta o}(s)}{1 + G_{\delta o}(s)}\]</div>
<p>where</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-eqDeltaLoop2">
<span class="eqno">(9)</span>\[G_{\delta o}(s) = k_\delta G_{nm} \left(\frac{\delta}{T_\delta}\right)_b(s)\]</div>

values for the open steer angle loop</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-eqDeltaLoopNumerical">
<span class="eqno">(10)</span>\[G_{\delta o}(s)|_{k_\delta = 1} =
\frac{4990.0342 (s+2.934) (s-2.934)}
{(s+17.08) (s+2.56) (s^2 - 1.306s + 5.18) (s^2 + 43.02s + 900)}\]</div>
<p>The characteristic equation is 6th order and the caster, capsize, and
neuromuscular modes are all stable whereas the weave mode is unstable. The
first loop closure will drive the unstable weave pole out to a higher frequency
and mid-range damping ratio.</p>
<p>To set the damping ratio multiple approaches can be taken. Here I&#8217;ll show a
Bode design approach and a root locus based design. For the Bode design we
select a gain that creates a damped neuromuscular peak near 10 rad/s,
<a class="reference internal" href="#figdeltabode"><em>Figure 10.8</em></a>. For this bicycle and speed, a gain of ~17.5
will set the inner loop as desired.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="figdeltabode">

<p class="caption">The Bode plots of the closed steer loop with various gains. Notice how the
higher gains start to increase the bandwidth by pushing the neuromuscular
pole closer to a frequency typical of human operator and plant dynamics

</div>
<p>By plotting the root locus of the closed loop poles as a function of
<span class="math">\(k_\delta\)</span> the desired gain can also easily be picked off on a root locus
diagram, <a class="reference internal" href="#figdeltalocus"><em>Figure 10.9</em></a>. The root locus of the steer closed
loop poles as a function of <span class="math">\(k_\delta\)</span> gives an idea where we can push
the poles for the next loop closure. Notice that the poles associated with the
weave mode at <span class="math">\(k_\delta=0\)</span> are pushed into the stable regime and back out
again, crossing the 0.55 damping ratio line twice. There is a range of gains
between about 4.0 and 17.5 which cause all of the oscillatory modes to have at
least 0.55 damping ratio. This is very clear when plotting the damping ratio
versus gain in <a class="reference internal" href="#figdeltadamp"><em>Figure 10.10</em></a>. The best choice typically is
to set the gain such that the pole is at the highest frequency allowable with
minimum damping, to give typically observed human operator behavior. This will
set up the bandwidth of the subsequent loops to be high enough for good system
performance.</p>

<a class="reference internal" href="#figphidotdamp"><em>10.12</em></a> we see that we need to set the roll rate gain to a
negative values, about -0.44. Since the bicycle with steer control exhibits
non-minimum phase behavior, we need to introduce a positive feedback on roll
rate. So it turns out that with a small negative gain we can maintain the
neuromuscular mode behavior but introduce the required sign change for
stability. This gives the desired 10 dB peaking in the Bode diagram,

<p>The bicycle-rider system is similar enough in nature for speeds above 2 m/s
that this loop closure seems to always work. We&#8217;ve had some trouble stabilizing
the model at speeds below 2 m/s, with the choice of <span class="math">\(k_\delta\)</span> an
important factor in the ability to stabilize at low speeds. <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#lange2011">[DL11]</a>
reported difficulties stabilizing his system below about 2 m/s too. We&#8217;ve found
that relaxing the 10 dB peak requirement on the inner most loop such that the
neuromuscular mode is more damped, will allow for successive closure and a
stable system for lower speeds. But as we all know, the bicycle is very
difficult for a human to balance at extremely low speeds. The fast time
constants compounded with human neuro processing delays makes this true. There
are slow bicycle riding competitions that take advantage of this fact
to test the balancing skill of the rider.</p>
<p>With the roll rate loop closed, the final three loops can be closed by setting
the gain such that the crossover frequency of the roll loop is 2 rad/s and the
outer loops crossover at half the previous frequency. This is easily set by
measuring the gain of transfer function at the desired crossover frequency and
realizing that a change in gain will raise or lower the gain curve.</p>

<p>At this point all the loops are closed and the bicycle can track a given path
with good performance. The closed loop system bandwidth is approximately equal
to the open loop crossover frequency of the lateral deviation loop.

<p>The gains can be computed across a relevant speed range for the bicycle. We
developed an algorithm for automatically selecting the appropriate gains for
difference physical parameter values and at different speeds. <a class="reference internal" href="#figgains"><em>Figure
10.19</em></a> shows how the gains vary with respect to speed for a
particular bicycle and rider. Notice that at higher speeds the gains change
somewhat linearly, but at speeds below 3 m/s there is non-linear variation.
These gains give stable systems which are capable of the lane change maneuver
but, due to the difficulties in selecting the gains with the rules above, the
algorithm may be making poor choices, especially for <span class="math">\(k_{\dot{\phi}}\)</span>, at
very low speeds.</p>

<p>We automated this method based on the Bode design guidelines. The gain choices
for proper neuromuscular peaks in the inner most loops require good initial
guesses, as there are often multiple solutions. The correct solution puts the
neuromuscular natural frequency at a typical value for human operators.</p>

<h3>Software<a class="headerlink" href="#software" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We designed a software suite in Matlab to implement the automated gain selected
for various bicycles, riders, and speeds. The software was constructed around a
Simulink version of the model described above and offers this functionality:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>It generates the state space form of the linear Whipple model for any
parameter sets and speeds. The outputs include all eight of the configuration
variables and their derivatives reported in Chapter <a class="reference internal" href="eom.html#eom"><em>Bicycle Equations Of Motion</em></a> with the
addition of the front contact point. This includes the lateral force input
described in Chapter <a class="reference internal" href="extensions.html#extensions"><em>Extensions of the Whipple Model</em></a>.</li>
<li>It generates the state space form of the closed loops system as a function
of the bicycle-rider parameters, the speed, the five gains and the
neuromuscular frequency.</li>
<li>It computes the gains with the sequential loop closure guidelines described
above for any give bicycle-rider and speed. (Very low speeds may require some
manual tweaking.) The open and closed loop transfer functions for each loop
can be returned and or plotted. It can also do this for roll torque as the
input as described in <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#hess2012">[HMH12]</a>.</li>
<li>It simulates the system performing a single or double lane change with a
given or computed set of gains and plots the results.</li>
<li>It computes the lateral force input transfer functions.</li>
<li>It computes the handling quality metric described in <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#hess2012">[HMH12]</a>.</li>
<li>It plots the gains versus speed.</li>
</ol>
<p>The software was used to generate most of the results and plots in <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#hess2012">[HMH12]</a>
and the source code for doing so is included. The source can be downloaded at
