<h2>Preface<a class="headerlink" href="#preface" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>At the beginning of 2009 I was in Delft working with Jodi and Arend on much of
the work explained in the previous chapters. I was still also in contact with
Mont and Luke back in Davis. Before I had come to Delft, Luke had mentioned the
possibilities of applying for an NSF grant to fund the remainder of our bicycle
dynamics projects. This was enticing, as there were few sources of grant
funding over the years for in the Davis lab. We really needed some dedicated
research time, as we spent the first few years taking teaching assistant
positions which ate up most of our available research time outside of our
classes. I fortunately got a Fulbright grant for the 2008 school year which
gave me a year&#8217;s stipend so that I could focus on research and on top of that
Jodi&#8217;s PhD budget helped fund the practical research costs in Delft and some of
my conference trips. At the beginning of December 2008 Luke sent me an email
with a renewed interest in applying for the NSF grant and Mont seemed to be on
board. Mont also talked with Ron and got him interested. We spent the next two
months writing our grant proposal using video conferencing and collaborative
word processing to get it done. The basic idea was to pair Ron&#8217;s manual control
expertise with our bicycle dynamics expertise to study the dynamics, control
and handling qualities of bicycles with the theoretical constructs supported by
extensive experimentation. Our work paid off and we received the grant, albeit
at a smaller amount than asked for so we had to cut back some of the scope
(which Arend had correctly forecast of being too large!). This set us up for a
two year study where we&#8217;d develop a manual control model, verify it and the
basic bicycle dynamics with both an instrumented bicycle and a robotic bicycle,
and wrap it up with some work on handling qualities predictions.</p>
<p>When I got back to Davis in September 2009 we started gearing up for the grant
work that would start October 1st. I had to get my qualifying exam done in
October and I also signed up for a Spanish class (which wasn&#8217;t necessarily a
good idea for the grant&#8217;s sake). Luke also took some programming classes and
this gave us a really slow start, as neither Luke or I realized that the scope
of what we had to do didn&#8217;t really allow any more time for classes. We got
moving though and started to plan out the bicycle(s) we were going to build.</p>
<p>Our proposal called for two bicycles, but somehow Luke and I hatched a plan to
build a single multi-purpose bicycle to &#8220;save money and time&#8221;. Arend sent
Danique over in January 2010 to do her internship with us. She was an excellent
intern and made great progress on the custom data acquisition system we had
envisioned. We decided to use a low level microprocessor, the Arduino, paired
with with a set of digital sensors for data acquisition and control. During
this time, Luke and I had our roughest moments working together which was
mostly rooted in my frustrations with the progress of this bicycle design. I&#8217;d
already built a bicycle with Jodi that did almost everything I needed and I
felt like I was reinventing the wheel and wasting time with all this low level
data acquisition work. Things eventually broke down after the stress boiled to
the top and we sat down with Mont to figure out how to solve things. The
conclusion was to split the bicycle back into two and each of us move forward
more independently. I think this was the absolutely right move for me in terms
of getting the project done as I planned and the stress immediately went away.
But the part I&#8217;m still bothered about was my inability to work in a direct team
with Luke when the pressure to get things done was high. I know that if we work
together, the final product would be many times greater than our independent
work because of our complimentary skill sets, but conflicting visions of the
final product and the path to get there really put a wall between us. I&#8217;m
continually learning how to do teamwork and probably always will be. I doubt it
is one of my strong points, as I always tend to want control. I hope that I can
develop strong team environments for my students in the future.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the instrumented bicycle moved forward. I was awarded an extra
grant to cover my stipend for the summer of 2010 so we hired Gilbert, a new
student in our lab, to help us out for the summer. Between me, Gilbert, and our
undergraduate interns Mohammed, Stephen, Eric, and Chet we plowed through the
bicycle construction through the summer pretty much putting the instrumented
bicycle back on schedule for experimentation in the fall. But even with the
summer push, it ended up taking me all fall quarter and some into the new year
to get the bicycle in a working state and ready for the experimentation. This
chapter discusses the design and operation of the Davis instrumented bicycle.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This chapter details the design and implementation of an instrumented bicycle
capable of accurately measuring the essential kinematics and kinetics
associated with human control of the bicycle.</p>
<p>I had originally considered using motion capture for the kinematics as we had
very successful results measuring the complete kinematic configuration of the
bicycle and rider with motion capture techniques as explained in Chapter
<a class="reference internal" href="motioncapture.html#motioncapture"><em>Motion Capture</em></a>, but I no longer had access to a system as good as the one
at the Vrije Universiteit. The systems available in Davis could capture the
motion on the treadmill but were not especially not suited to capture the
motion of the bicycle on the ground. With this in mind, we decided to expand
upon the on board measurement techniques used in the Delft Instrumented bicycle
as the basic design principle. This would allow the bicycle to collect data in
a variety of environments. The most notable downside was inaccurate location
tracking of the system. But we concluded that this wouldn&#8217;t be detrimental to
system identification and moved forward with the instrumentation.</p>
<p>The bicycle&#8217;s primary design criteria were as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Sized for our intended riders: average adult males.</li>
<li>Restrict the rider&#8217;s biomechanical movement to more closely meet the Whipple
model rigid rider assumption. This in turn also required the bicycle to be
self propelled so that the rider does not have to move their legs to pedal.</li>
<li>Accurately measure the rider&#8217;s applied steering torque.</li>
<li>Accurately measure the fundamental kinematics of the bicycle: three
dimensional rates and orientations of the bicycle rear frame, front frame,
and wheels.</li>
<li>Accurately apply and measure a lateral disturbance force to the bicycle
frame.</li>
</ul>
<p>From early on, I intended to attempt some experiments with some constrained
rider biomechanical motion, such as leaning, because the interplay of the
various control inputs available to the rider, such as leaning, are a common
theoretical research topic with little experimental backing. This led to
secondary design criteria that as the project progressed were never fully
implemented, but I&#8217;ll discuss them for completeness. They are as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Restrict the rider&#8217;s body motion to a limited set and measure the additional
kinematics: hip roll, torso relative to hip lean, torso relative to hip
twist, and lateral knee motions.</li>
<li>Measure the additional reaction forces between the rider and bicycle: forces
and moments in the seat post and forces at the foot pegs.</li>
</ul>
<p>These criteria framed the subsequent design choices described herein.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="bicycle">
<h2>Bicycle<a class="headerlink" href="#bicycle" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We needed a bicycle that would allow for easy modification and various mounting
points for sensors and data acquisition equipment. Our original requirements
for a bicycle were as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Steel frame for easy modification and welding.</li>
<li>Disc brake brackets for mounting the wheel speed encoders.</li>
<li>100mm front dropout spacing and 135mm rear dropout spacing.</li>
<li>1-1/8&#8221; thread-less headset to allow for easy modification.</li>
<li>Cylindrical tubes for head, down, top, and seat tube (i.e. nothing non standard)</li>
<li>Horizontal top tube for equipment mounting purposes.</li>
<li>Threaded rack mount for instrumentation mounting.</li>
<li>Accept 700c rims with high pressure tires.</li>
<li>Frame size: 54-58cm for our intended riders.</li>
<li>An electric hub motor for forward propulsion.</li>
</ul>
<p>We ended up choosing a large size Surly 1x1 model, <a class="reference internal" href="#figsurly"><em>Figure
9.1</em></a>. It is designed as a single-speed off-road bicycle for 26&#8221;
wheels with fat tires, but can be setup with 700c higher pressure tires. The
frame is constructed from butted 4130 CroMoly steel tubing. It has both front
and rear cantilever brake mounts in addition to disc brake mounts. Otherwise it
met all of our requirements. We purchased some standard components including
700c aluminum wheels with 23c Continental Gatorskin high pressure tires and
basic handlebars and brakes.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="figsurly">

<p class="caption">The Surly 1x1 with 700c wheels and basic handlebars for upright seating. An
Amped Bikes geared hub motor is shown installed along with the lead acid
battery kit on the rear rack.</p>
</div>
<p>To allow the bicycle to be propelled without requiring the rider to pedal, we
opted for a bicycle electric hub motor kit. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ampedbikes.com">Amped Bikes</a> graciously donated both direct drive and geared
kits which included the motors, controllers, throttle, and 36 volt lead acid
batteries. I used the direct drive version on the instrumented bicycle. The
lead acid batteries were very heavy so we purchased a light, ~2.8 kg, 36 volt
lithium ion battery as a substitute to help decrease the bicycle weight. The
kit comes with a motor controller with a rudimentary &#8220;cruise control&#8221;. We
needed some form of cruise control to allow the rider to set the speed during
the experiment allowing them to focus their attention on lateral control as
opposed to throttle control. The Amped Bike cruise control worked well for the
experiments performed on the floor, but was more difficult to match the cruise
control to the speed of the treadmill. Some sort of feedback control would
alleviate the difficulties, but we made due. The exposed wires from the hub
motor are also easily susceptible to damage. The bicycle fell over once,
damaging the wires and shorting the Hall effect sensors in the hub. I spent a
couple of weeks repairing it<a class="footnote-reference" href="#hubdamage" id="id1">[1]</a>. Overall, the motor met our needs
for constant speed propulsion and the single battery would last through an
entire day of experimentation, but was susceptible to being easily damaged.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rider-harnesses">
<h2>Rider Harnesses<a class="headerlink" href="#rider-harnesses" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The bicycle was designed to accommodate a range of allowable rider motions. I
designed it with three modes in mind. First, the rider can simply have
complete free rider biomechanical motion as they would when normally riding a
bicycle. The second design was intended to restrict almost all of the rider&#8217;s
ability to move with respect to the bicycle frame to better mimic the rigid
rider assumptions in many bicycle models. And third, a harness was designed
to restrict the rider&#8217;s movement to a particular subset of hypothesized
dominant motions.</p>
<div class="section" id="rigid-rider">
<h3>Rigid Rider<a class="headerlink" href="#rigid-rider" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Rigid rider models are often employed in single track vehicle research but the
rider has been rigidified very few times in experimental work. This is
potentially problematic as the rigid rider assumption is a large one.
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#stassen1973">[SVLB+73]</a> made use of a rider brace in their bicycle simulator to
prevent rider lean. <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#eaton1973">[Eat73b]</a> rigidified his motorcyclists&#8217; torso and
performed several perturbation tests with the rider&#8217;s hands off the handlebars!
He found it difficult to identifying the linear modes of motion.
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#doyle1987">[Doy87]</a> comments on the utility of rigidifying the rider which was an
example of his techniques to simplify the system, but he left the rider free to
move in his experiments. Jim Papadopoulos has been a proponent of using
recumbent bicycles in studies due to the natural rigidification of the rider.
His thoughts and the difficulties we had in the studies from Chapters
<a class="reference internal" href="delftbicycle.html#delftbicycle"><em>Delft Instrumented Bicycle</em></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="motioncapture.html#motioncapture"><em>Motion Capture</em></a> influenced my decision to restrict
the rider&#8217;s motion.</p>
<p>I constructed a harness such that the rider was rigidified as much as possible
with respect to the rear frame, <a class="reference internal" href="#figrigidharness"><em>Figure 9.2</em></a>. A medical
back brace was used to rigidify the spine and hip motion. I then attached the
brace to the bicycle frame via a stout adjustable arm.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="figrigidharness">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_images/rigid-harness.jpg"><img alt="_images/rigid-harness.jpg" src="_images/rigid-harness.jpg" style="width: 3in;" /></a>
<p class="caption">Jason strapped into the rigid rider harness. The arm allows for multiple
degrees of adjustability to allow different riders and seating positions.</p>
</div>
<p>I fashioned some knee straps with strong magnets taken from computer hard
drives which would engage with a ferrous attachment plate on the frame so that
the rider&#8217;s legs would be rigid with respect to the rear frame, <a class="reference internal" href="#figkneerestraints"><em>Figure
9.3</em></a>. Chapters <a class="reference internal" href="delftbicycle.html#delftbicycle"><em>Delft Instrumented Bicycle</em></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="motioncapture.html#motioncapture"><em>Motion Capture</em></a>
showed the rider tends to use lateral knee motions and we wanted to eliminate
that as a confounding factor. The magnets were weak enough that the rider could
remove his legs in an emergency.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="figkneerestraints">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_images/knee-restraints.jpg"><img alt="_images/knee-restraints.jpg" src="_images/knee-restraints.jpg" style="width: 6in;" /></a>
<p class="caption">The left image shows the knee straps with hard drive magnets and the right
image shows the knee attachment plates mounted to the top tube of the
bicycle.</p>
</div>
<p>These restrictions left the rider&#8217;s arms and head free to move. The arm motion
was required for controlling the bicycle, although one could imagine fixing the
rider&#8217;s arms and only allowing control with motion of their hands. The head
probably should have been rigidified with respect to the body cast, but we
didn&#8217;t due to comfort reasons<a class="footnote-reference" href="#halo" id="id5">[2]</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="restricted-motion">
<h3>Restricted Motion<a class="headerlink" href="#restricted-motion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A second harness was partially developed to restrict the rider&#8217;s motion to that
described in <a class="reference internal" href="extensions.html#secflexiblerider"><em>No Hands</em></a>. A back brace which left the hips free to
move was used to keep the spine straight and a custom-molded hip brace was
developed to hold securely to the pelvis, <a class="reference internal" href="#figrestrictedharness"><em>Figure
9.4</em></a>. The plan was to attach the hip brace to the
bicycle seat via a revolute joint in the roll direction which would allow the
hips to <em>only</em> roll about the seat. The back brace would then be attached to
the hip brace via a joint which would allow torso lean with respect to the
hips. The feet would be attached to the foot pegs via clip-in pedals. Forces
applied from the feet to the foot pegs would effectively allow the rider&#8217;s hips
to roll with respect to the bicycle frame (in reality because the rider is more
massive and more inert, the bicycle frame would roll with respect to the
inertial reference frame).</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="figrestrictedharness">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_images/restricted-harness.jpg"><img alt="_images/restricted-harness.jpg" src="_images/restricted-harness.jpg" style="width: 3.957in;" /></a>
<p class="caption">The hip and upper torso harnesses.</p>
</div>
<p>My hypothesis was that this harness would allow for the essential motion and
torque application needed to effectively control the bicycle with no hands and
would provide the next effective means of control to complement steer torque
when riding with hands. This design was only partially finished, so the merits
of it were never tested.</p>

<div class="section" id="orientations-rates-and-accelerations">
<h2>Orientations, Rates and Accelerations<a class="headerlink" href="#orientations-rates-and-accelerations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The two most important states that describe the lateral dynamics of the bicycle
are roll and steer (as defined in Chapter <a class="reference internal" href="eom.html#eom"><em>Bicycle Equations Of Motion</em></a>). Ideally one would like
to measure the angular orientation, angular rate, and angular accelerations of
both the rear frame and the front frame. Sensors that allow direct, independent
and accurate measurements of each are ideal, to avoid having to estimate
measurements through differentiation, integration, or state estimators. The
kinematics of each body need not be measured if they are connected to the rear
fame via revolute joints, only measurement of the extra degree of freedom for
each connected body relative to the rear frame is required. <a class="reference internal" href="#tabkinematicsensors"><em>Table

<p>The yaw, roll, pitch and steer rates, are typically measured directly with rate
gyros, which have been available for the later half of the 20th century. The
direct measurement of angular accelerations has yet to mature <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#ovaska1998">[OV98]</a>, so
numerical differentiation and filtering of the angular rates is often used. The
angular accelerations can also be computed if the acceleration and location of
multiple points are measured with accelerometers. Most all experimental work
with bicycles and motorcycles provides good examples of employing these type of
kinematic sensors.</p>
<div class="section" id="roll">
<h3>Roll<a class="headerlink" href="#roll" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The roll angle is typically the most difficult kinematic measurement due to the
fact that both the bicycle translates with respect to the ground plane making
mechanical measurement difficult and that the ground plane may not be normal to
earth&#8217;s gravitational field. Herein, we did not concern ourselves with the
later because all of our experiments were on level ground. Integration of the
easier roll rate measurement is an option, but definite initial conditions and
some way to account for the drift due to integration are required, and not
necessarily trivial. Past researchers have measured the roll angle with a
variety of methods from trailers and third wheels to lasers and rate gyros with
complementary state estimators.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#dohring1953">[Doh53]</a> used a trailer to measure roll angle. <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#kageyama1959">[KF59]</a>
and <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#fu1965">[Fu65]</a> introduced one of the earliest direct roll angle measurements.
They made use of a third wheel attached to one side of the motorcycle and
measured the angle between the wheel mounting arm and the motorcycle frame.
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#singh1964">[Sin64]</a> also used a third wheel after having little luck with
accelerometers and rate gyros. He obtained decent measurements but abandoned
the wheel because it was too large, dangerous and susceptible to vibration.
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#roland1971">[RM71]</a> measured roll angle with a potentiometric free gyro with
seemingly good results. Their data was captured with direct write recorders in
a pace car. <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#eaton1973">[Eat73b]</a> used a third wheel and a potentiometer to measure
roll angle on a motorcycle, but also had reliability issues. <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#zytveld1975">[VZ75]</a>
used a small trailer with two roller skate wheels and potentiometer to measure
the roll angle on this robotic motorbike.</p>
<p>More modern techniques often focus around roll angle estimation.
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#boniolo2008">[BTS08]</a>, <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#boniolo2009">[BST09]</a> developed a simple algorithm to remove
the low frequency drift and only require yaw rate, roll rate and speed
measurements to get peak roll estimation errors of 5 degrees, which were larger
than we could accept. But their methods did allow for roll angle estimation on
banked curves. Distance lasers have been used to directly measure the roll
angle with respect to the ground but are particularly expensive
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#evertse2010">[Eve10]</a>. The roll angle can also be estimated with a state
estimator such as a Kalman filter (<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#gustafsson2002">[Gus02]</a>,
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#teerhuis2010">[TJ10]</a>). The plant in the Kalman filter can be general 3D motion
of a rigid body or a model of the bicycle. Constraining the estimation with the
use of a bicycle model as the plant could have drawbacks when using the
resulting angle for model validation but can give potentially great results
otherwise. These types of algorithms are implemented in many modern sensor
packages and we decided to pursue one of these.</p>
<p>There is a class of sensors called Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) and/or
Attitude Heading Reference Systems (AHRS) that have recently become very
affordable and small enough to be appropriate for orientation and rate
estimation due to the advent of MEMs rate gyros, accelerometers, magnetometers,
and GPS technologies. An IMU can theoretically be rigidly affixed to each body
of the system to give complete kinematic details of the motion of that body.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Inertial Measurement Units</dt>
<dd>An inertial measurement unit typically measures three body fixed components
of angular rate of a rigid body and the three dimensional acceleration of a
single point.</dd>
<dt>Attitude Heading Reference System</dt>
<dd>An attitude heading reference system measures what an IMU does but also
often includes earth magnetic field measurements and/or GPS combined with a
microprocessor and estimation algorithm to additionally provide orientation
and/or location estimations.</dd>

<p>Many of these systems were within our budget range so we scouted various
companies (MemSense, Navionex, MotionNode, MicroPilot, Crossbow, VectorNav, Ch
Robotics, etc.) to see what was offered<a class="footnote-reference" href="#imus" id="id19">[3]</a>. We ended up choosing the VN-100
development board from a relatively new company called <a class="reference external" href="http://www.vectornav.com">VectorNav</a> due to price, on board orientation calculations, and
the potential ease of collecting data via a typical RS-232 serial interface. My
preferred software tools, Matlab and Python, both had good serial interface
packages. We placed a single VN-100 on the rear frame to measure the angular
orientations and rates along with the acceleration of a point on the rear
frame. The VN-100 relies on additional magnetometer readings and an on-board
proprietary algorithm based on a Kalman filter for computing the real time
orientation about the three axes.</p>
<p>The VN-100 turned out to be a poor choice for our application in multiple ways,
the second of which I&#8217;ll talk about in a later section. The first is that the
orientation estimations were very poor. I wanted <em>at least</em> accurate estimate
of the roll angle of the bicycle. The VN-100 repeatedly was not able to provide
this. VectorNav worked with me and tried offer various methods of tuning the
VN-100 with state covariance weightings for the Kalman filter and also to tune
out any static magnetic fields from the bicycle frame, but with no success. The
issues were associated with both the wheel and front frame relative rotations
to the rear frame, with could cause varying disturbances in the magnetic field.
The hub motor also negatively affected the sensor readings and these may have
been too great to tune out. I also realized that going with a proprietary
generic estimator is a bad idea, especially when one has a good model of the
dynamics of the rigid body that the sensor is attached to. In our case if the
Kalman filter was programmable, we could tailor it with the bicycle model to
improve the orientation estimation significantly. Also if the VN-100 could
accept input signals, the filter could be tuned well too. After countless hours
trying to tune their proprietary filter I gave up and went with a classic roll
angle measurement design that I should have done in the beginning.</p>
<p>I designed a simple trailer, <a class="reference internal" href="#figrolltrailer"><em>Figure 9.5</em></a>, that was pulled
behind the bicycle to measure roll angle with a potentiometer, much in the way
the steer angle was measured. The trailer needed to be light such that it
didn&#8217;t adversely affect the lateral dynamics and be able to give a good
estimate of the roll angle. All of our experiments were to be on smooth
surfaces, so the vibration issues that on-road tests have seen were of little
concern. I designed the trailer around two caster style polyurethane wheels
(roller blade wheels). They were attached to a frame which attached via a
revolute joint aligned with the roll axis to a yoke that attached at the axle
of the rear wheel.</p>

<p>The potentiometer effectively measures the angle between the yoke and the main
trailer frame<a class="footnote-reference" href="#rolltrailer" id="id20">[4]</a>. For a direct measurement of the true roll angle
of the bicycle, the trailer roll axis must lie in the ground plane, but this is
physically impossible so it is preferable for the axis to be as close to the
ground as possible. <a class="reference internal" href="#figtrailerangle"><em>Figure 9.6</em></a> shows how the yoke pitch
angle and the trailer roll angle change as functions of the bicycle roll angle
for various heights above the ground. Notice that the trailer roll angle is
virtually identical to the bicycle roll angle for given heights.</p>

<h3>Steer<a class="headerlink" href="#steer" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The steer angle is easy to measure with either some form of write recorder,

and <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#dohring1953">[Doh53]</a> makes use of a mechanical write recorder. Because the front
frame is attached to the rear frame via a revolute joint only an additional
single orientation and rate measurement is needed to measure the front frame
motion. I used a similar design and setup as the Delft instrumented bicycle,
<a class="reference internal" href="#figsteersensors"><em>Figure 9.7</em></a>: a potentiometer for relative steering angle
measurement and a single axis rate gyro for the body fixed angular rate of the
front frame about the steer axis<a class="footnote-reference" href="#rategyro" id="id23">[5]</a>. I modified the design with some
minor improvements such as better tension adjustability and switching to a

<p>As has been shown in previous chapters, bicycle dynamics are highly dependent

simple friction generator for a bicycle light <a class="reference internal" href="#figspeedometer"><em>Figure

the sidewall of the tire which is radius <span class="math">\(r_c\)</span> from the wheel hub.

<h2>Kinetics<a class="headerlink" href="#kinetics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A human is able to use contact forces and body movements to control the
bicycle. The forces applied by the rider&#8217;s hands to the handlebars are the most
obvious and most effective method of controlling the bicycle <a class="footnote-reference" href="#rollcontrol" id="id24">[6]</a>.
But the rider also can impart forces through the seat and the foot pegs. If the
rider is controlling the bicycle without touching the handlebar, these would be
the only locations of rider to bicycle contact. For a complete dynamic picture
of the rider&#8217;s control inputs, all of the essential forces and moments at the
rider/bicycle interface&#8217;s need be measured. In the case of the rigidified
rider, the steering torque is sufficient for characterizing the control inputs.</p>
<p>For the sake of perturbing the closed loop bicycle/rider system, we also needed
to measure and externally apply force or torque. We opted for a simple lateral
force perturbation.</p>
<div class="section" id="lateral-perturbation-force">
<h3>Lateral Perturbation Force<a class="headerlink" href="#lateral-perturbation-force" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>I was introduced to the idea of external lateral force perturbations from some
of my first email exchanges with Arend and when I was in Delft we did several
experiments with lateral perturbations <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#kooijman2009a">[KSM09]</a>. We applied the
impulsive type of perturbations without measuring the applied force assuming
they could be modeled as impulses. There are also many other past attempts at
exciting the system. <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#roland1971">[RM71]</a> on the other hand attached a calibrated
rocket to the handlebars of a riderless bicycle to give a known step input to
steer torque. <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#eaton1973">[Eat73b]</a> had the motorcycle rider tap the handlebars to
apply an impulse and also drop weights from the side of the motorcycle to
apply a roll torque. <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#doria2012">[DFT12]</a> similarly had the motorcycle rider apply
impulsive forces to the handlebars to excite the weave mode. <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#lange2011">[DL11]</a>
discusses several methods of applying a roll torque to the bicycle
including a mass swing, a mass slider, a rope, and laterally accelerating the
ground. His designs are intended to apply an oscillatory roll torque to
facilitate system identification in the frequency domain<a class="footnote-reference" href="#idealinput" id="id30">[7]</a>.</p>
<p>We weren&#8217;t able to come up with a clever way of perturbing the system with a
harmonic input and frankly I did not think a great deal about the perturbation
methods, so I simply attached a 100 lb force load cell (Interface SSM-100) in
line with a rope attached to the underside of the bicycle seat. We intended to
apply impulsive lateral forces to the bicycle rear frame. This worked for the
first round of experiments, but only provided a negative lateral force as it
could only be pulled. After the first experiment attempts, we solved this by
attaching the load cell in line with a push/pull stick which was attached to
the seat via a ball joint, <a class="reference internal" href="#figlateralforcestick"><em>Figure 9.9</em></a>. The ball
joint prevented any external moments from being applied to the bicycle and the
force to be in a mostly lateral direction.</p>

<p class="caption">The lateral force stick attached to the underside of the seat. A rod end was
used at the connection to prevent moments from being applied to the rear
frame.</p>
</div>
<p>We were also concerned with the rider predicting the lateral perturbations.
Ideally the rider shouldn&#8217;t be able to predict the instant or the direction of
the upcoming perturbation. The rider wore a helmet with a blinder on the side
of the lateral force stick so that they could not see the movements of the
stick or the person operating the stick. And secondly, we wrote a simple
program which randomly instructed the perturber when and in which direction to
apply the force for the treadmill experiments. During the runs in the
gymnasium, we retained the blinder and provided the perturber with a series of
random push/pull sequences before each run. The operator applied as many
perturbations as possible over the length of the track, which didn&#8217;t give much
unpredictability in the time of perturbation. <a class="reference internal" href="#figperturbation"><em>Figure

<h3>Seat Post<a class="headerlink" href="#seat-post" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As already mentioned, I had intended to measure the forces at all of the
rider/bicycle interfaces. Cal Stone <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#stone1990">[Sto90]</a> developed a seat post which
was capable of measuring five components of force in the seat post with an
array of strain gauges. I was going to add a strain gage bridge for the
remaining unmeasured component, torque about the seat axis, to complete the
force measurements and use the seat post in combination with the flexible rider
harness. The seat post was originally instrumented by simply gluing strain gage
bridges onto a stock seat post and carefully calibrating the sensor for a
variety of loading combinations. The accuracy of the seat post force
measurements was not all that high due to the small strains seen along the
outer wall of the seat post. In a way, the use of the seat post was more because
of the convenience of having access to it than obtaining the actual kinetics
involved when using the flexible rider harness. Gilbert and I spent a
lot of time figuring out how to use and calibrate the seat post and associated
equipment. Fortunately, a copy of Cal&#8217;s research notes were found that helped
decipher most of the work. We even got in touch with Cal and he provided
additional information. But as time constraints weighed in, we had to abandon
the effort.</p>

<h3>Steer Torque<a class="headerlink" href="#steer-torque" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A rider applies forces to the handlebars that cause the front frame to rotate
relative to the bicycle frame. These forces can be lumped into an effective
steer torque. Steer torque is the most effective natural input to control a
bicycle and the input that the human most often utilizes. <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#roland1972">[RL72]</a>
explicitly differentiates steer torque based control from steer angle as
opposed to <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#lunteren1969">[VLS69]</a> which hypothesized that steer angle was the
controlled input. <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#weir1972">[Wei72]</a> demonstrates that steer angle control input
has poor gain and phase margins as compared to steer torque control input.
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#weir1979a">[WZT79]</a> shows that a no hand lane change is much less &#8220;precise and
efficient&#8221; as to one done with steer torque control. <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#sharp2008a">[Sha08]</a> shows
that steer torque is always the optimal control input when the cost function is
based on control power. Accurately measuring the applied steer torque can
provide rich data with which to understand the bicycle dynamics and the
validity of the underlying models. But steer torque is one of the more
difficult variables to properly measure. The required steering torque for
controlling a bicycle in normal maneuvers is of relatively low magnitude,
typically less than 5 Nm. This small torque can be swamped by the other
potentially large forces a rider may apply to the bicycle&#8217;s handlebars. These
small torque magnitudes require a well designed load cell to give accurate
measurements.</p>
<p>There are very few published studies that measure or attempt to measure steer
torque on a bicycle or lightweight single track vehicles and these measurements
typically do not match the results of the analytical models. There have been
more attempts at measuring the steer torque on motorcycles.</p>

<dd>David de Lorenzo instrumented a bicycle which could measure pedal,
handlebar, and hub forces to characterize the in-plane structural loads
during downhill mountain biking. The handlebar forces were measured with a
handlebar sensitive to <span class="math">\(x\)</span> (pointing forward and parallel to the
ground) and <span class="math">\(z\)</span> (pointing upwards, perpendicular to the ground) axis
forces on both the left and right sides of the handlebar. Net torque about
any vector in the fork plane of symmetry can be calculated from the applied
forces. Figure 3d in the paper shows a single plot of steering torque with
maximums around 7 Nm. The stem extension torque (representing the torque
from pushing down and up on the handlebars) reaches 15 Nm, which is about
twice the maximum steer torque shown. The calibration details lead me to
believe that the crosstalk from the all of the forces and moments on the
handlebars gives a very low accuracy for the reported torques, probably in
the <span class="math">\(\pm 1\)</span> to 3 Nm range.</dd>
<dt><a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#jackson1998">[JD98]</a></dt>
<dd>They don&#8217;t measure steer torque explicitly but attempt to predict the
contributions to the torques acting on the front frame based on orientation,
rate and acceleration data taken while riding a bicycle with no-hands. They
show a single graph with torques under <span class="math">\(\pm2.5\)</span> Nm acting on the front

<dd>This is a report about a design project at UCSB to develop and implement a
steer torque measurement device on a bicycle. The experiments and
measurements seem to be one of a kind for bicycles up to that point in time.
They begin with doing some basic experiments by attaching a torque wrench to
a bicycle and made left at right turns at speeds from 0 to 13 m/s (0 to
30mph). The torques were found to be under 5 Nm except for the 13 m/s trial
which read about 20 Nm. They designed a pretty nice compact torque
measurement setup by mounting the handlebars on bearings and using a linear
force transducer to connect the handlebars to the steer tube, <a class="reference internal" href="#figcheng"><em>Figure
9.12</em></a>, which reduced the effects of other moments and forces
acting on the steer tube. It seems that downward forces applied to the
handlebars could possibly still be transmitted to the load cell. The design
does allow one to choose the lever arm for the load cell, thus giving some
choice to amplify the force signal. They set it up to measure from 0 to 84
Nm with a Model SM Series S-type load cell from Interface with a 670 Newton
range. This range is quite large with respect to the torque values found in
the first experiments. They self calibrated the sensor with with a set of
pulleys and cables to apply a pure torque to the handlebars. They measured
the torque during two different maneuver types: a sharp turn at various
angles and steady turns on various diameter circles, both at 10 mph (4.5
m/s). The rider maintained constant speed through visual feedback of a
speedometer. The signals were very noisy and Cheng filters the data with a
moving average. He was not able to identify any countersteering. Cheng
claimed the rider turns the handle bars right to initiate a right turn,
which is counter to what models and other experiments predict. For the sharp
turns the highest reported torque is about 10 Nm, for the steady turning
they report the highest average torque as 1 Nm.</dd>

<dd>They construct a bicycle with a steer motor and controller which treats the

rider&#8217;s steer torque contribution is estimated from the motor torque and the
handlebar and motor moments of inertia. Little detail is given to properly
assess the design, but measuring steer torque by motor current may be
effective. They are one of the few studies that takes into account some of
the inertial effects of the handlebar.</dd>

<dd>He designed a custom torque sensor that fit inside a bicycle steer tube. He
mostly removed the crosstalk effects due to an axial load on the sensor, but
the design still seems very likely susceptible to bending moments on the
steer tube. He also didn&#8217;t account for the dynamic inertial affects of the
handlebar and fork/wheel which are above and below the sensor, but this is
most likely inconsequential for steady turns. His measured steer torques for
steady turns never exceeded 2.4 Nm. He wasn&#8217;t able to predict steer torque
well with his bicycle model and only points to the fact that the sensor was
90% oversized for an explanation of the poor results.</dd>

<p>Steering torque has been measured in relatively few instances of bicycle
experiments and not many more for motorcycles. Of these, very few of
the designs may actually measure a pure rider applied steer torque. This is
more consequential for bicycles than motorcycles because the small torques used
in typical bicycle control are certainly less than 10 Nm with the majority less
than 5 Nm. <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#ouden2011">[VDO11]</a>, in particular, showed how sensitive the torque
measurements are to other handlebar loads. Also, most of these designs measure
the torque somewhere between the rider hands and the ground contact point.
This is a physically ideal way to measure the steer torque, but no one has
accounted for the dynamic inertial effects of the front frame above or below
the sensor. <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#evertse2010">[Eve10]</a> may be the only design which mitigates this issue.
I&#8217;ll show later in this chapter that for maneuvers that require large steer
angular accelerations, that this is a significant additive effect.</p>
<p>With these previous works in mind, I wanted to develop a very accurate steer
torque measurement system for our bicycle. If one is interested in extracting
the &#8220;pure torque&#8221; applied by the rider to control the bicycle for model
validation purposes, it is critical to take care of several important details.</p>
<p>Another thing to note is the differences in magnitudes of steer torques in the
bicycle models as compared to the bicycle experiments. The steer torque used to
control the various models presented are much lower than the measured values.
This implies that there may be some missing components of torque in the models,
especially with respect to tire interactions with the ground.</p>
<p>I started by taking some crude steer torque measurements myself, similar to the
first method presented by <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#cheng2003">[CBAS03]</a>, as I hadn&#8217;t found Cheng&#8217;s paper or any
of the post 2008 references yet. Secondly, I address the issue of the potential
loads acting on the steer tube other than steer torque. And finally, I show the
calculations to account for the inertial effects of the front frame.</p>

<p>This set of experiments enforces the previously cited experimental findings
that steer torques in bicycle control are typically very small. Ideally our
sensor&#8217;s range should be somewhere around <span class="math">\(\pm 8\)</span> to 10 Nm.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="forces-on-the-steer-tube">
<h4>Forces on the steer tube<a class="headerlink" href="#forces-on-the-steer-tube" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Measuring the steer torque is not trivial. This is because various models
predict torques ranging in the 0-2 Nm (0-1.5 ft lbs) range with signal
variations and reversals requiring <span class="math">\(\pm 0.01\)</span> Nm (0.01 ft lbs) in
measurement accuracy. The range and accuracy are easily measured with modern
torque sensors, but the fact that large moments can be applied to the fork and
handlebars by the ground and/or rider introduces the problem of crosstalk. The
forces and moments applied to the fork will corrupt the relatively small torque
measurements as they can be hundreds of times larger in magnitude. With this in
mind, we seek a way to isolate the torque measurement to eliminate or minimize
the crosstalk and get good, noiseless, accurate readings.</p>
<p>One of the simplest ways to measure steer torque may be to apply a strain gauge
bridge primarily sensitive in torque to the steer tube of the fork. This method
and others would require that the cross sensitivity of the bridge to other loads
in the steer tube to be negligible. For example, <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#lorenzo1997">[DL97]</a> effectively did
this with his handlebar design but used several other bridges to measure
additional moments and forces in handlebar assembly and calibrated the set of
bridges together to help eliminate the crosstalk. The measured steer torques
are less than 10 Nm and the loads due to the applied forces at the wheel
contact, headset bearings and handlebars can potentially be orders of magnitude
greater. <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#ouden2011">[VDO11]</a> clearly experienced the difficultly in removing the cross
talk from a steer torque sensor and few studies have explicitly addressed this.</p>
<p>Assuming we may want to measure steer torque somewhere between the handlebars
and fork crown, a simple static analysis can be performed to gage the relative
magnitudes of loads in the steer tube. The bicycle steer tube has various other
forces acting on it. For the most basic case, the ground contact force at the
front wheel puts the fork into bending and compression. Likewise the person can
apply forces to the handlebars which also put the steer tube into bending and
compression. <a class="reference internal" href="#figbicycleforces"><em>Figure 9.21</em></a> shows the free body diagram
for a bicycle statically loaded.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="figbicycleforces">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_images/bicycle-forces.png"><img alt="_images/bicycle-forces.png" src="_images/bicycle-forces.png" style="width: 2.5in;" /></a>
<p class="caption">The free body diagram allows for an external steering torque, independent
downward forces on each handlebar, the ground reaction forces and a force
acting on the mass of the bicycle and rider due to vertical acceleration.
The vertical acceleration is simply due to gravity when static, but can be
thought of as a multiple of the acceleration due to gravity for dynamic
purposes.</p>
</div>
<p>The forces and moments acting on the fork can be isolated algebraically and the
fork modeled as a basic beam supported by the headset bearings (points C and D)
and the forces/moments due to the ground reaction force and force applied to
the handlebars were calculated and applied to points A and B, <a class="reference internal" href="#figforkbeam"><em>Figure
9.22</em></a>.</p>

<p>The following graph, <a class="reference internal" href="#figforkload"><em>Figure 9.23</em></a>, shows what the shear and
bending moment diagrams for a 2g vertical acceleration and ~200 N force on one
handlebar grip look like both from the side and the front of the bike.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="figforkload">

</div>
<p>This graph shows that the bending moments and shear stresses can be of much
larger magnitude than the steer torques. Misalignment of strain gages and the
resulting sensor crosstalk are magnified by the differences in loads and need to be
carefully accounted for. If the cross talk strains due to the bending moments
are even 1% of the of the total strain due to the moments, that can still
corrupt the steer torque measurement.</p>
<p>This analysis also predicts that if no loads are placed on the handlebars the
entire portion of the steer tube/stem above the headset has no bending moments
and no shear stress. This could be the ideal place for a torque sensor, if one
can eliminate the transfer of forces applied by the handlebars to the steer
tube.</p>
<p>This lead me through several design ideas but ultimately to a design that
isolates the steer torque sensor from the handlebar and fork loads with a zero
backlash telescoping double universal joint. The idea solidified after thinking
about an upside down tall bike I had created several years before. This
bicycle&#8217;s tall handlebar, to reach the high rider, was attached to the bicycle
stem at the headset by a horizontal revolute joint which prevented the rider
from applying a fore/aft moment to the handlebar extension, but the rider could
still apply steer torques. My design exploited this odd feature by using a

<p class="caption">The final steer torque design. The steer torque sensor is mounted atop the
universal joint such that the only load component which can be transferred
through the sensor is an axial torque.</p>
</div>
<p>I attached the universal joint to a Futek 150 in-lb (<span class="math">\(\pm 17\)</span> Nm) TFF350
torque sensor for accurate torque measurements. The torque sensor overloads at
150% of the rated output (i.e. 22.5 Nm), so some care was needed to protect the
sensor from overload and to prevent the rider from losing steer control if the
sensor were to break. I found a &#8220;slip&#8221; clutch distributed by <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sdp-si.com">Stock Drive
Products</a> (SDP). It turned out that the device was the
Torq-Tender manufactured by <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zero-max.com">Zero-Max Inc.</a>, but as
usual practice SDP doesn&#8217;t readily provide that information. This particularly
expensive torque overload protection turned into a major headache. SDP lists
the rated torques but with no indication of the operating speed the torques are
measured at. It turns out they are with respect to an 1800 rpm operating speed.
My rates were rather low, I purchased a much larger torque sensor than I
needed. It was rather painful trying to get them to change the springs around
the Christmas holidays and check the torque rating at zero rotational speed.
The second issue had to do with it not actually being a slip clutch. I wanted
the torque protection to slip at a given torque (just under overload of the
sensor). The friction based slipping would still allow the rider to control the
bicycle, but SDP mistakenly called them &#8220;slip clutches&#8221; when in fact they are
more like binary torque limiters and transfer little to no torque after the
limit is reached, so the rider would most likely crash if the torque limiter
broke loose. Thirdly, there was play in the torque limiter. I used shim
material to take up much of the play, but there remained some backlash. I
ultimately locked the slip clutch and relied on careful attendance of the
bicycle and the fact that the rider was unlikely to ever apply greater than
22.5 Nm of torque. The runs 0-226 may have a tiny bit of play in the torque
limiter and for runs greater than 226 the limiter was locked.</p>

<h4>Steer Dynamics<a class="headerlink" href="#steer-dynamics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The final design was setup to exclusively measure the torque in the steer tube
along the steer axis, but this measured torque, <span class="math">\(T_M\)</span>, is not the same as
the input torque used for our bicycle models, (i.e. <span class="math">\(T_\delta\)</span>). The
steer torque in the model is defined as the torque between the front frame and
the rear frame about the steer axis. If the torque sensor measures the steering
torque anywhere but at the interface of the human&#8217;s hands and the front frame,
one must account for the inertial effects of the front frame. As far as I can
tell, no one who has measured steer torque on a single track vehicle has
accounted for these effects. There is a relationship from <span class="math">\(T_M\)</span> to
<span class="math">\(T_\delta\)</span> that requires one to know, at a minimum, the friction in
the steer axis bearings above the torque sensor (this is potentially both
viscous and Coulomb) and the inertial characteristics of the front frame above
the torque sensor<a class="footnote-reference" href="#elastic" id="id80">[8]</a>.</p>
<p>In our case, we measured the torque in the steering column, <span class="math">\(T_M\)</span>, from a
sensor that is mounted between the handlebars and the fork. The sensor was also
mounted between two sets of bearings: the headset and the slip clutch bearings.
We are interested in knowing the torque applied about the steer axis by the
rider&#8217;s contact forces to the handlebars, <span class="math">\(T_\delta\)</span>.</p>

<p>To estimate <span class="math">\(t_B\)</span> and <span class="math">\(c_B\)</span>, we set up the bicycle such that the
steer axis was vertical, the front wheel was off the ground, and the rear frame
was rigidly fixed in inertial space. We then attached two springs of stiffness
<span class="math">\(k\)</span> each to the handlebars such that the force from the springs acted on
a lever arm, <span class="math">\(l\)</span>, relative to the steer axis, <a class="reference internal" href="#figsteerexperiment"><em>Figure

<p class="caption">An overhead view of the steer friction experimental setup. The steer axis of
the bicycle is vertical and the bicycle frame is secured such
that it is rigid with respect to the earth. The wheel was isolated from
rotation relative to the fork. Two springs in series were attached to the
handlebars.</p>
</div>
<p>This configuration allowed us to apply small perturbations to the handlebars
and measure the dampened vibrations in the steer angle, steer rate, and steer
torque. For the first set of trials the sensors were mounted as they normally
are, with the steer angle and rate measurements taken just above the headset
and the steer torque measured between the upper and lower bearing sets. We also
took data for a second set of trials with the steer rate sensor mounted to the
top of the steer column in case the steer column to account for any torsional
flexibility.</p>

<p>The length of the lever arm was 0.231 meters. The spring stiffness was
estimated by suspending an 11.4 kg mass from one of the spring and letting it
oscillate while measuring its vertical acceleration via an accelerometer. A
grey box identification routine was used to estimate the spring stiffness for
three trials. We found the average spring stiffness to be <span class="math">\(904.7 \pm 0.6\)</span>
N/m. The inertia of the handlebar, fork, and front wheel about the steer axis,
<span class="math">\(I_{HF}\)</span>, was computed based on the measurements described in Chapter
<a class="reference internal" href="physicalparameters.html#physicalparameters"><em>Physical Parameters</em></a> and found to be <span class="math">\(0.1297+/-0.0005\)</span> <span class="math">\(kg
\cdot m^2\)</span><a class="footnote-reference" href="#inertia" id="id83">[9]</a>.</p>
<p>The friction coefficients are found with a non-linear grey box identification
based on the measured steer angle over 15 trials (runs 209-223) where the
steering assembly was perturbed from equilibrium. The resulting viscous
coefficient is <span class="math">\(c_B = 0.34 \pm 0.04\)</span> <span class="math">\(N \cdot m \cdot s^2\)</span> and the
Coulomb coefficient is <span class="math">\(t_B = 0.15 \pm 0.05\)</span> <span class="math">\(N \cdot m\)</span>.</p>
<p>To calculate the applied steer torque, <span class="math">\(T_\delta\)</span>, we need an estimate of
the upper bearing friction, <span class="math">\(T_U\)</span>. A simple assumption is that the
friction in the upper bearings equals the friction in the lower bearings,
<span class="math">\(T_U = T_B / 2\)</span>, but for some of the trials we measured the torque
between the bearings, the steer angle just above the lower bearings and the
steer rate above the upper bearings. This information allows the estimation of
the upper and lower bearing friction independently. The equations of motion of
the assembly above the torque sensor are</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-eqUpperBearingEOM">

\operatorname{sgn}(\dot{\delta}) + 2 k l^2 \delta = -T_m\]</div>
<p>The friction coefficients of the upper bearings can be estimated by treating
the measured torque as an input and the measured steer rate as the output in a
non-linear grey box formulation. The moment of inertia, <span class="math">\(I_G\)</span>, of the
handlebars about the steer axis, i.e. the portion above the torque sensor, is
computed from the physical parameter measurement described in Chapter
<a class="reference internal" href="physicalparameters.html#physicalparameters"><em>Physical Parameters</em></a> and is <span class="math">\(0.0656 \pm 0.0003\)</span> <span class="math">\(kg \cdot
m^2\)</span>.</p>
<p>Assuming <span class="math">\(I_G\)</span>, <span class="math">\(k\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(l\)</span> as fixed parameters gave poor
fits (around 50% of the data variability was accounted for by the model), and
thus most likely poor estimates of the friction coefficients. The viscous
coefficient was found to be <span class="math">\(c_U = 0.6 \pm 0.1\)</span> and the Coulomb friction
as <span class="math">\(t_U = 4.0E-8 \pm 7E-8\)</span>. These results are questionable. From the
previous excellent estimates of <span class="math">\(I_{HF}\)</span>, I would have not expected our
<span class="math">\(I_G\)</span> number to be a poor estimate, but this leaves either our
precomputed value of <span class="math">\(I_G\)</span> or the measure torque <span class="math">\(T_m\)</span> as the most
likely candidates to being incorrect. If <span class="math">\(I_G\)</span> is a free parameter the
identification produces outputs that fit the data well, but <span class="math">\(I_G\)</span> is
different than what was found with other techniques, <span class="math">\(I_G = 0.0955 \pm
0.0005\)</span>. The fits for the 7 trials rose to over 87% of the variability
explained by the model and the viscous friction was <span class="math">\(c_U = 0.38 \pm 0.06\)</span>
and the Coulomb <span class="math">\(t_U = 0.08 \pm 0.06\)</span>. The same can be done to compute
the lower bearing friction, but the fits were very poor. The results of finding
the upper bearing and lower bearing friction are inconclusive. So the
assumption that the upper friction is half of the total friction is used to
compute the actual steer torque.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that the bearings are under load when a rider is seated
on the bicycle and that we didn&#8217;t measure the friction under that loading of
the bicycle and rider&#8217;s weight.</p>

2 Nm of additional torque is required for the rider to overcome the friction

to the inertial effects. This extra torque may be negligible in motorcycle
dynamics, but must be accounted for when studying the much lighter bicycle.</p>

<h3>Time Synchronization<a class="headerlink" href="#time-synchronization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When we originally chose to use the VectorNav VN-100 and the NI USB-6218 with a
netbook PC, we had convinced ourselves that they would all work together
seamlessly. The manufacturers of each device seemed to think so and their
disconnected knowledge helped convince us too. This turned out to be very
wrong. The main issue, which seems to rear its head often in data acquisition,
is time synchronization of all the hardware involved. A PC running a typical
operating system is not capable of detailed and strict time management of
processes. This is certainly true of collecting serial data from two
independent devices. My intention was to collect data from both the VN-100 and
the USB-6218 simultaneously with the Matlab Serial I/O and Data acquisition
toolboxes, hopefully triggering the initial collection of data from the two
devices simultaneously or by reading the VN-100 serial data through the
USB-6218.</p>
<p>The simultaneous triggering was hampered primarily by the VN-100&#8217;s asynchronous
data transfer and no apparent ways to either start it with a trigger or by
recording some signal from it through the USB-6218. It may be possible to read
serial data through the USB-6218, but I did not figure it out. It very well may
have been missing the features to do so, or that Matlab didn&#8217;t have a robust
enough interaction with the USB-6218 to do so. I struggled quite a bit with
this unforeseen issue and we started devising solutions to measure an
identical event with both the VN-100 and the USB-6218 and to synchronize the signals
afterwards. <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#ouden2011">[VDO11]</a> had to use a similar technique. We would need to
select a sensor which was also on the VN-100 and then excite the two sensors
with the same event. Ideally this event would be a step input to both sensors.
We tried rate gyros and accelerometers but couldn&#8217;t come up with an adequate
event, until we mentioned the problem to Ron and he immediately suggested just
riding over a bump! This was the ticket. We ended up attaching an additional
three axis accelerometer to the VN-100 development board which would read the
same vertical component of acceleration and constructing a bump for the bicycle
to travel over at the beginning of each run. This provided us with two signals
which could be synchronized in time.</p>
<div class="section" id="bump">
<h4>Bump<a class="headerlink" href="#bump" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The accelerometers had a <span class="math">\(\pm 3\)</span> g range, so we needed a bump which would
provide vertical accelerations within that range for speeds from 1 to 7 m/s.
For a sinusoidal shaped bump, the vertical acceleration for a given speed can
easily be computed. The height of a bump as a function of time is</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-eqBumpHeight">
<span class="eqno">(25)</span>\[y(t) = \frac{h}{2}\left[1 - \operatorname{cos}\left(\frac{2 \pi v}{L}t\right)\right]\]</div>

<span class="math">\(L\)</span> is the length of the bump. The acceleration</p>
<div class="math">
\[\frac{d^2 y(t)}{dt^2} = 2 h \left(\frac{\pi v}{L}\right)^2
\operatorname{cos}\left( \frac{2 \pi v}{L} t \right)\]</div>
<p>Because the cosine varies from -1 to 1, the maximum acceleration due to the
bump and acceleration due to gravity is</p>
<div class="math">
\[a = 2 h \left(\frac{\pi v}{L}\right)^2 + g\]</div>
<p>The maximum height of a 1 meter long bump and forward speed of 7 m/s to give
a 3 g acceleration is</p>
<div class="math">
\[h = \frac{a - g}{2}\left(\frac{L}{\pi v}\right)^2 =
\frac{3 (9.81 \textrm{ m/s}) - 9.81 \textrm{ m/s}}{2}
\left(\frac{1 \textrm{ m}}{\pi (7 \textrm{ m/s})}\right)^2 = 0.020 \textrm{ m}\]</div>
<p>I fashioned a very low sinusoidal bump from wood that we laid on the track on
the floor at the beginning of the track, <a class="reference internal" href="#figbump"><em>Figure 9.35</em></a>  and also
launched under the bicycle on the treadmill. The bump launching is somewhat
amusing and we had to construct a &#8220;bump catcher&#8221; so that the bump didn&#8217;t fly
off the back of the treadmill and hurt anyone or anything, <a class="reference internal" href="#figbumpcatcher"><em>Figure

<h3>Signal Synchronization<a class="headerlink" href="#signal-synchronization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The bump provides the event and the acceleration output of the tandem
accelerometers logs the event. The time shift between the two signals can be
computed by minimizing the least squares error of one signal minus the other
signal which has been interpolated at the sample times of the first signal.

<p>The basic algorithm for computing the error between the two signals is:</p>

<li>Shift the NI signal some time <span class="math">\(\tau\)</span>.</li>
<li>Truncate both signals around the common data.</li>
<li>Interpolate the NI signal at the VN time samples.</li>

<p>Using this formulation, then minimize the error with respect to

function has local minima. I use both the location of the max values in the
signals and finding the minimal value of the error as a function of a fixed
number of <span class="math">\(\tau\)</span> values to get good guesses. See the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">BicycleDataProcessor</span></tt> source code for the details. The computed time

<h3>Data Processing<a class="headerlink" href="#data-processing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To handle processing the large amount of data, I developed an object oriented
program, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/moorepants/BicycleDataProcessor">BicycleDataProcessor</a>, in Python that
interacts with an HDF5 database containing the data. The program makes use of
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.pytables.org">PyTables</a> for database interaction and the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.scipy.org">SciPy/NumPy</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net">matplotlib</a> stack for computation and plotting. The
program is structured around three classes:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Signal</dt>
<dd>This is a subclass of the NumPy ndarray. It tracks a 1 dimensional time
series along with its units. There are basic methods for typical signal
processing such as differentiation, filtering, and frequency spectrum.</dd>
<dt>RawSignal</dt>
<dd>This a subclass of Signal for the raw signals. The attributes are populated
from the database. In addition to the Signal methods, it has the ability to
scale the signal based on calibration data.</dd>
<dt>Sensor</dt>
<dd>This class contains calibration data for particular sensors and has methods
to extract the correct calibration constants based on calibration date.</dd>
<dt>Run</dt>
<dd>This is the primary class which stores the meta data and signal data for a
specific run. It has methods to process the raw data into  more
meaningful time series that are useful for analyzing the bicycle dynamics.
There are also methods for plotting and exporting the data.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The data collection and initial processing follows this pattern:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Collect data during a run via the BicycleDAQ software. This stores the
metadata and raw signal data for each run in a Matlab mat file.</li>
<li>Build the complete HDF5 database with BicycleDataProcessor by importing all
of the run and calibration data files.</li>
<li>Load runs from the database and manipulate them for further processing such
as plotting.</li>
</ol>
<p>This approach works well and allows for easy querying of the 700+ runs for
further data analysis. The processed data can be exported to generic file
formats or as ones compatible with Matlab. This example gives the basics of
loading a run and plotting the processed data in <a class="reference internal" href="#figprocesseddata"><em>Figure

<h2>Conclusion<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In this chapter I gave a detailed description of the Davis instrumented bicycle
with the hope that enough information is present for someone to make use of the
bicycle and/or recreate one (of course with improvements). The bicycle served
us well in terms of the kinematic and kinetic data we were interested in
collecting.</p>
<p>Some recommendations for improvements are as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Power the entire system from the hub motor battery to reduce the number of
batteries.</li>
<li>The steering universal joint needs keyways instead of set screws for a more
solid connection.</li>
<li>Get rid of the VN-100 and replace with two analog rate gyros for yaw and roll. This
would take away the time synchronization issue. The newer versions of the
VN-100 offer more capabilities including synchronization signals, so that could
be looked into, but overall it is still a poor (and expensive) choice for
this application.</li>
<li>Add some gearing to the roll angle measurement for better resolution, and
develop a more accurate calibration scheme, perhaps by making use of the
on-board accelerometers.</li>
<li>Do away with the torque limiter. Another solution for safeguarding the sensor
and rider in case of failure is needed.</li>

between the yoke and the trailer frame. This is somewhat limiting as the
full range of the potentiometer isn&#8217;t utilized as was in the steering angle
design. This effectively reduces the measured voltage range from the
potentiometer, especially since the measured angles are often no more than
10 degrees. The NI USB-6218 has 16 bit resolution so it still adequatedly
measures the data, but a step down gearing would improve the resolution of
the roll measurement.</td></tr>
