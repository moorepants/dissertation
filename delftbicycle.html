<h2>Preface<a class="headerlink" href="#preface" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I had contacted the authors of <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#meijaard2007">[MPRS07]</a> in the early winter of 2006
to try to get some tips on where to go with my master&#8217;s thesis, which I wanted
to do on the handling qualities of bicycles. I had previously come across
Arend, Jaap, and Jim&#8217;s conference paper <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#schwab2004">[SMP04]</a> on their benchmark
Whipple model and used it to help me build and validate my first model earlier
that year. Andy, Jim, and Arend all replied, Jim at great length as usual, and
the seeds were sown for some future collaboration. Jim began flooding my inbox
with years of thoughts on the handling of bicycles and it turned out that Arend
had just applied for a big grant to fund two PhD students for bicycle handling
research that was uncannily similar to what I was dreaming up myself. I hadn&#8217;t
decided to do my PhD at UC Davis quite yet and Arend&#8217;s potential PhD slot was
enticing (Jodi was slated for one). But I ended up finishing my masters the
following spring and signing on for the PhD at Davis. That summer I started
thinking about applying for a Fulbright grant to study somewhere. I contacted
Arend again to see if he was interested in having me and he was excited. I told
him I was going to do it and then put it off. A week shy of the deadline, I
told Arend I didn&#8217;t have time to do it. He encouraged me to apply anyway and I
agreed to push through. I spent the next week putting together the proposal
full time and after several drafts I sent it off. I didn&#8217;t think about it much
after that, but luck was on my side and I received the acceptance letter from
the Fulbright commission the following spring. I was headed to the Netherlands
for my first time living abroad. In the meantime Arend found a way to fund a
PhD for Jodi so there was going to be some momentum and a teammate when I
arrived.</p>
<p>When I arrived in Delft at the end of August in 2008 Jodi was working on
several projects: a bicycle handling qualities review paper
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#kooijman2011a">[KS11]</a>, the two mass skate bicycle <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#kooijman2011">[KMP+11]</a>, and an
instrumented bicycle. I helped to some degree with all the projects, but
primarily with setting up the instrumented bicycle and planning a set of
experiments. This chapter details the work we did with the first instrumented
bicycle. I&#8217;ve taken the text directly from our conference paper
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#kooijman2009a">[KSM09]</a> and gone through it with some updates, clarifications,
and additions. Jodi and Arend were the primary writers of the paper. My
contributions were more of the experimental design, performing the experiments,
analyzing the data, discussing results and working on a visualization graphical
interface that we never really used due to the inability to synchronize the
video data we took with the sensor data.</p>

<h2>Abstract<a class="headerlink" href="#abstract" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The purpose of this study is to identify human control actions in normal
bicycling. The task under study is the stabilization of the mostly unstable
lateral motion of the bicycle-rider system. We studied this by visual
observation of the rider and measuring the vehicle motions. The observations
show that very little upper-body lean occurs in normal riding and that
stabilization is done primarily maintained by steering control actions.
However, at very low forward speed a second control action was observed: knee
movement. Moreover, the frequency of the control actions are all dominated by
the pedaling frequency, while the amplitude of the steering motion increases
rapidly with decreasing forward speed.</p>

<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Riding a bicycle is an acquired skill. At very low speeds the bicycle is very
unstable and requires great attention by the rider. However, at moderate speed
the bicycle is easy to stabilize, often with little conscious thought by the
rider. These observations are corroborated by a stability analysis on a simple
dynamical model of an uncontrolled bicycle <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#meijaard2007">[MPRS07]</a> and some
experiments <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#kooijman2008">[KSM08]</a> and <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#kooijman2009">[KS09]</a>. Although there is
little established knowledge on how a person stabilizes a bicycle, two basic
features are known: some uncontrolled riderless bicycles can balance themselves
given some initial speed, and one can balance a forward moving bicycle by
turning the front wheel in the direction of the undesired lean. But we all know
that a rider on a bicycle not only moves the handlebars but also may make use
of their upper body and other extremities. These rider body motions are even
more profound when riding a motorcycle in extreme maneuvers
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#cossalter2002">[CL02]</a>.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study is to identify the major human control actions in
normal bicycling focusing on the stabilization task.<a class="footnote-reference" href="#id21" id="id10">[1]</a> We use the term
&#8220;normal&#8221; to describe casual bicycling that requires minimal conscious control.
The identification is done by visual observation of the rider and measurement
of the motions of the instrumented bicycle, see <a class="reference internal" href="#figinstrumentedbicycle"><em>Figure
7.1</em></a>. In order to observe the human control actions a
number of experiments were carried out. First, a typical town ride was
performed to investigate what sort of actions take place during casual riding
through an urban environment. After this, experiments were carried out in more
controlled environment, a large treadmill (3 × 5 m), at various speeds. The
same bicycle was used during all the experiments. The bicycle was ridden by two
averagely skilled riders. Three riding cases were considered: normal bicycling,
bicycle without pedaling (towing), and normal bicycling with lateral
perturbations. These experiments were carried out to identify the upper body
motions and the effect of the pedaling motion on the control. The rider was
told to simply stabilize the bicycle and to generally ride in the longitudinal
direction of the treadmill; no tracking task was set. Recorded data included
the rigid body motions of the bicycle rear frame and the front assembly. The
rider motion relative to the rear frame was recorded via video.</p>

<h2>Instrumented Bicycle<a class="headerlink" href="#instrumented-bicycle" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A standard Dutch bicycle, 2008 Batavus Browser, was chosen for the experiments
and is shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#figinstrumentedbicycle"><em>Figure 7.1</em></a>. This is a bicycle of
conventional design, fitted with a 3-speed SRAM rear hub and coaster brakes.
Some of the peripheral components were removed in order to be able to install
measurement equipment and sensors (see <a class="reference internal" href="#tabequipment"><em>Table 7.1</em></a>). The
bicycle was equipped with a 1/3” CCD color bullet-camera with 2.9mm (wide
angle) lens. The camera was located at the front and directed towards the rider
and rotated 90 degrees clockwise to get portrait aspect ratio. The video signal
was recorded, via the AV-in port, on DV tape of a Sony Handycam located on the
rear rack of the bicycle. The bullet camera was placed horizontally,
approximately 65 cm in front of the handlebars and 1.2 m above the ground and
held in place by a carbon-fiber boom connected to the down-tube of the rear
frame, see <a class="reference internal" href="#figinstrumentedbicycle"><em>Figure 7.1</em></a>. This allowed us to view
the rider&#8217;s motion with respect to the bicycle frame.</p>

<p>We used a National Instruments CompactRIO (type CRIO-9014) computer for data
collection. The CompactRIO was installed on the rear rack of the bicycle. It
was fitted with a 32-channel, 16 bit analogue input module and a 4-channel, 16
bit analogue output module as well as a CRIO WLAN-MH1000 wireless modem by
S.E.A. Datentechnik GmbH for a wireless connection with a “ground station”
router, to which a laptop was connected. The measurement system is able to run
autonomously once a measurement sequence is initiated. The CompactRIO was
powered by a 11.1V, 1500 mAh Lithium Polymer battery which was also placed on
the bicycle’s rear rack.</p>
<p>The recorded signals were the body fixed roll, yaw, and steer rates, the steer
angle, the rear wheel speed, and the pedaling cadence frequency. The angular
rates were measured using 3 Silicon Sensing CRS03, single axis angular rate
sensors with a rate range of ± 100 deg/s. The steer angle was measured using a
potentiometer placed on the rear frame against the front of the head tube and
connected via a belt and pulley pair. The angular rate sensors and the angular
potentiometer were powered by a 4.8V, 2100 mAh Nickel Cadmium battery. The
forward speed was measured by measuring the output voltage of a Maxon motor
that was driven by the rear wheel. The cadence frequency was measured by a
reed relay placed on the rear frame, and a magnet placed on the left crank-arm.</p>

<div class="section" id="town-ride-experiment">
<h2>Town Ride Experiment<a class="headerlink" href="#town-ride-experiment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Our first basic experiment was a short, 15 minute ride around town. This
experiment took place under normal riding conditions (dry weather, day-light,
etc.), on roads familiar to the rider. The course covered included a
round-a-bout, dedicated cycling paths, speed-bumps, pavement, normal tarmac
roads, tight bends in a residential area and the rider had to stop at a number
of traffic lights. There were no special precautions taken and the experiment
was carried out amongst other traffic. From the recorded video and sensor data
two main observations were made:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The video data showed that there was very little upper body lean relative to
the rear frame during the entire ride. The small relative upper body lean
that was noted appeared to simply be a result of pedaling. Only in the last
few seconds prior to a sharp corner was an upper body lean angle observed,
indicating that the lean was carried out because of a sudden heading change.</li>
<li>The recorded data, part of which is shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#figtowndata"><em>Figure 7.2</em></a>,
clearly shows that only very small steering actions (± 3 deg) are carried
out during most of the experiment. Only when the forward speed has dropped,
prior to making a corner, are large steer angles (± 15 deg) seen.</li>

<h2>Treadmill Experiments<a class="headerlink" href="#treadmill-experiments" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Riding a bicycle on the open road amongst normal traffic subjects the
bicycle-rider system to many external disturbances such as side wind, traffic
and road unevenness. To eliminate these disturbances a more controlled
environment was selected to carry out further studies on human rider control
for stabilization tasks. The experiments were carried out on a large (3 × 5 m)
treadmill, shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#figtreadmill"><em>Figure 7.3</em></a>. The dynamics of a riderless
bicycle on a treadmill have been shown to be the same as for on flat level
ground <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#kooijman2009">[KS09]</a> for speeds between 4-6 m/s, so we make this assumption
for the case with a rider too, albeit with caution.</p>

<p>The experiments were carried out by two male, average ability riders of
different age and build on the same bicycle. The saddle height was adjusted for
each rider to ensure proper seating. The rider characteristics are given in
<a class="reference internal" href="#tabriders"><em>Table 7.2</em></a>. For both riders very similar results were found.
The data and figures presented in this chapter were collected with rider 1.</p>

</div>
<p>The uncontrolled dynamics of the bicycle rider system can potentially be
described by the linearized model of the bicycle <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#meijaard2007">[MPRS07]</a>. This model
consists of four rigid bodies: the rear frame with rigid rider connected, the
front handlebar and fork assembly, and the two wheels. These are connected by
ideal hinges and the wheels have idealized pure-rolling contact with level
ground. <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#moore2009a">[MKHS09]</a> describes the method used to determine the model
parameters for the instrumented bicycle-rider system<a class="footnote-reference" href="#id22" id="id14">[2]</a>. These parameters are
given in <a class="reference internal" href="#tabparameters"><em>Table 7.3</em></a> and the root locus of the system with
respect to speed is depicted in <a class="reference internal" href="#figdelftrootlocus"><em>Figure 7.4</em></a>. At low speed, the
dominant mode is the unstable oscillatory weave mode. This weave motion becomes
stable around 18 km/h, the weave critical speed. At higher speeds, the
non-oscillatory capsize motion becomes unstable but since its time to double so
long it is considered to be very easy to control. With those assumptions, we
assert that the instrumented bicycle rider system is in need of human
stabilizing control below 18 km/h and is stable otherwise.</p>

<p class="caption">Eigenvalues for the linearized stability analysis of an uncontrolled
bicycle-rider combination for the steady upright motion in the forward speed

</div>
<p>For safety reasons the riders were fitted with a harness that was connected to
the ceiling via a long climbing rope. This ensured that should the rider fall
over no contact with the moving part of the treadmill would be made. Also a
retractable dog leash was connected between the front of the harness and the
treadmill kill switch. This ensured that the treadmill would immediately come
to a halt, should the bicycle go too far back, reducing the chance that the
bicycle could go off the end of the treadmill.</p>
<p>Herein, three types of riding experiments are examined: normal bicycling,
bicycle without pedaling (towing) and normal bicycling with lateral
perturbations. The normal bicycling experiment was carried out to investigate
what type of control actions a rider carries out to simply stabilize a bicycle.
The towing experiment was carried out to remove the effects of the dominant
pedaling motion, seen during the town-ride experiment, from the system. The
bicycling with lateral perturbations was performed to investigate how the human
rider recovers from a lateral impulsive force applied to the rear frame.</p>
<p>Each of the three experiments was carried out at 6 different speeds: 30, 25,
20, 15, 10 and 5 km/h. In total 36 experiments were performed. During the
normal bicycling and bicycling with lateral perturbations experiments the rider
pedalled normally and used first gear during the 5 and 10 km/h runs. Second
gear was used in the 15 and 20 km/h runs and third gear was used during the
25 and 30 km/h runs. The cadence varied between 24 rpm at 5 km/h and 80 rpm at
30 km/h. During the towing series of experiments, the bicycle and rider were
towed by a rope connected to the bicycle rear frame at the lower end of the
head tube. The rider kept the pedals in the horizontal position during these
experiments. The crank arm side that was placed forward was left to rider
preference. During the lateral perturbations experiment the bicycle was
perturbed by applying a lateral impulse to the rear frame. The impulse was
applied by manually yanking a rope tied to the seat tube. The rider could not
see the rope being actuated to ensure that the rider was unprepared, however,
they knew the direction of the perturbation which was always a pull from the
right.</p>
<p>The riders were instructed to stay on the treadmill and to generally ride in
the longitudinal direction of the treadmill but not to concentrate on their
exact position on the treadmill. We wanted the rider to focus on stabilization
and maintaining heading and not to track lateral deviation. Sensor data was
collected for 1 minute during each experiment at a 100Hz sample rate and the
video data was collected simultaneously.</p>
<p>This video shows Arend slowly decreasing in speed. Notice the increase
in steering motions as speed decreases and the little relative upper body
motion at all speeds. The knees' lateral motion increases with decreasing
speed also.</p>

<h2>Normal Bicycling<a class="headerlink" href="#normal-bicycling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Visual inspection of the video footage showed very little rider lean action
during the experiment other than what resulted directly from the pedaling
motion. During the low speed runs at 5 km/h, the rider’s upper body was almost
stationary, i.e. it could be considered to be rigidly attached to the rear
frame. However at this speed the rider’s knees showed significant lateral
motion. This lateral knee motion can be seen in the video image in Figure
<a class="reference internal" href="#figknee"><em>Figure 7.5</em></a>. A third observation was that the rider actuated the
handlebars with higher amplitudes at lower speeds than at higher speeds.</p>

<p class="caption">Video still of normal pedaling at low speed (5 km/h) showing large lateral
(left) knee motion and (right) steering action. The grey vertical line
indicates the mid-plane of the bicycle. Note that there is little upper
body lean.</p>
</div>
<p>This third observation is confirmed by the measured steer angle data. Figures
<a class="reference internal" href="#figsteernormal20"><em>7.6</em></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="#figsteernormal5"><em>7.7</em></a> show the time
history of the steer angle for the experiments carried out at 20 and 5 km/h,
respectively. The standard deviation of the steer angle during the sixty
seconds of measurement is also shown in the figures. At speeds above 20 km/h
the average steer angle remains approximately constant. However the average
magnitude of the steer angle grows by more than 500% when the speed is
decreased from 20 km/h to 5 km/h. This increase in steer angle magnitude for
the decreasing speeds is illustrated in Figure <a class="reference internal" href="#figsteersigma"><em>Figure 7.8</em></a>.
This jump in steering amplitude could be indicative of a threshold at which the
system becomes harder to control, but there is no apparent connection to the
open loop dynamics. For example, the change in both the weave mode time to
double and natural frequency is approximately the same between 5 and 10 km/h as
between 10 and 15 km/h.</p>

<p>The frequency content of the steering signal for the different forward speeds
is shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fignormalfreq"><em>Figure 7.9</em></a>. The grey vertical dashed line
indicates the rigid rider-bicycle weave frequency. We were not able to
ascertain any connection between the dominate measured frequencies and the
natural frequency of the weave mode. We had hypothesized that for speeds in the
stable speed range, the optimal control frequency of the rider would correspond
to the weave frequency, due to the fact that an uncontrolled bicycle-rider
system recovers from perturbations at its natural frequency. The black vertical
dashed line in each of the plots in Figure <a class="reference internal" href="#fignormalfreq"><em>Figure 7.9</em></a>
indicates the measured pedaling frequency. The figure shows that during normal
pedaling most of steering action takes place at, or around, the pedaling
frequency, irrespective of the speed that the bicycle is moving. The pedaling
frequency is especially dominant in the steering signal at the highest speeds
where practically all of the steering takes place at the pedaling frequency.</p>

<h2>Towing; no pedaling<a class="headerlink" href="#towing-no-pedaling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Visual inspection of the video footage revealed, similar to the normal
bicycling experiment, that little to no upper body leaning occurred at any of
the measured speeds and that larger steer angles occurred at the slower speeds.
However, unlike the normal bicycling experiment, no knee motion was noticed
from visual inspection of the video footage at any of the speeds, other than
small remnant motion as a result of slight steering deviations from straight
ahead. The recorded steer angle data also confirmed that larger steer angles
were made at decreasing speeds. <a class="reference internal" href="#figsteersigma"><em>Figure 7.8</em></a> shows how the
standard deviation of the steer angle reduces rapidly with increasing speed up
to 20 km/h and from then on remains approximately constant. The figure also
shows that the average steering amplitude at all speeds is lower than that for
the pedaling case. The standard deviation is less than a degree for all speeds
above 10km/h indicating that little to no steer action is required at higher
speeds.</p>
<p>The steer angle frequency spectrum for each of the speeds is shown in
<a class="reference internal" href="#figtowfreq"><em>Figure 7.11</em></a>. It was once again expected that the rigid
rider/bicycle weave frequency would be a dominant frequency in the frequency
spectrum, especially with no pedaling. However there appears to be no
connection with the open loop weave frequency even in the unstable speed range.
In fact the frequency spectrum shows a wide range of frequencies of similar
amplitude at all the speeds and none of the speeds seem to show any noticeable
dominant frequencies.</p>

<div class="section" id="perturbing-pedaling">
<h2>Perturbing; pedaling<a class="headerlink" href="#perturbing-pedaling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The video footage showed that, as a result of the lateral perturbation, the
bicycle was pulled laterally away from under the rider causing the bicycle to
lean over and in turn cause a short transient lean motion of the rider’s upper
body. The upper body appears to only lag behind the lower body and bicycle
during this destabilizing part of the perturbation maneuver. During the
subsequent recovery of the bicycle to the upright, straight ahead position, no
body lean could be noted other than that as a result of the normal pedaling.</p>
<p>A second phenomenon observable in the video footage, as shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#figperturb"><em>Figure
7.12</em></a>, is that at all speeds we observed a lateral knee motion
during the short transient recovery process of the bicycle to the upright
position. The lateral knee motion was very large during the 5 km/h measurement
and much smaller at the higher speeds, but even at 30 km/h it is visible.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="figperturb">

rider’s right by a rope at the saddle tube) at 5 km/h. Vertical grey line
indicates the bicycle mid-plane. Note the lateral right knee motion and

</div>
<p>From the video footage we also concluded that the angle that the handlebars are
turned during and after a perturbation decreased with increasing speed as can
also be seen in the measured steer angle data as shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#figsteersigma"><em>Figure
7.8</em></a>.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="#figperturbfreq"><em>Figure 7.13</em></a> shows the frequency spectrum of the measured
steer angle. Once again, for the higher speeds, the steer control action is
carried out at the pedaling frequency. At the lower speeds (5 - 10 km/h) a
wider frequency range is again present but the pedaling frequency is dominant.
<a class="reference internal" href="#figmaxamp"><em>Figure 7.10</em></a> shows the steering amplitude for the frequency
with the maximum amplitude. Again the values for the highest speeds are
similar to those of the standard deviation of the steer angle.</p>

place at the rigid rider-bicycle weave natural frequency for any of the speeds.</p>

<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The observations show that human stabilization control of the lateral motions
of a bicycle during normal bicycling show little use of upper body lean, and
that the primary control actions done through steering control. Only at very
low forward speed is a potential second control action observed: knee movement.
Moreover, this lateral knee motion seems to only occur while pedaling. The
steering actions are dominated by the pedaling frequency while the amplitude of
the steering motion increases rapidly with decreasing forward speed.</p>

<div class="section" id="experiments">
<h3>Experiments<a class="headerlink" href="#experiments" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As usual with the data deluge, we analyzed very little of the data. We recorded
a total of 109 one-minute runs with two different riders. The previous
sections detail only some analysis on runs from a single rider and did not
include results from all of the experiments. As a result, the statistical
significance of the presented analysis is somewhat weak. The following list
details all of the experiments we performed:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Normal pedaling at five speeds in which we started at the low speed, sped up
to the highest and then sped down to the lowest giving twelve runs for each
rider. (runs 1-6, 8-19, 101-106, 108-113)</li>
<li>Normal pedaling starting at 5 km/h and decreasing speed until the rider could
no longer balance with both riders. (runs 20, 21, 107, 114)</li>
<li>Without pedaling (towed) at five speeds in which we either started at the low
speed, sped up to the highest and then sped down to the lowest or did the
opposite with both riders. (runs 22-27, 29-34, 115-120, 122-123, 126-131)</li>
<li>Without pedaling starting at 5 km/h and decreasing speed until the rider could
no longer balance with both riders. (runs 28, 121, 124, 125)</li>
<li>Riderless weave stability test in which we increased the speed
from 12 km/h to 25 km/h to try to detect the weave critical speed of
the bicycle. We didn&#8217;t have much luck getting the bicycle to stabilize at all.</li>
<li>Lateral perturbation at six speeds for each rider. (runs 132-133)</li>
<li>No hand balancing with pedaling for one rider. (runs 60-71)</li>
<li>Lane changes for both riders at six speeds. (runs 160-165, 80-85)</li>
<li>A single attempt at riding with eyes closed at 30 km/h<a class="footnote-reference" href="#id23" id="id17">[3]</a></li>
<li>Line tracking at six speeds for one rider. (runs 90-96)</li>
</ul>
<p>There is potentially considerable amount of findings and better statistical
conclusions that can be made from the data.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rate-gyros">
<h3>Rate Gyros<a class="headerlink" href="#rate-gyros" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We mounted three rate sensors to the bicycle to collectively measure the yaw
rate, <span class="math">\(u_3\)</span>, roll rate, <span class="math">\(u_4\)</span>, and the steer rate, <span class="math">\(u_7\)</span>.
<a class="footnote-reference" href="#id24" id="id18">[4]</a> We attached a rate gyro to the fork and handlebar assembly which measured
the body fixed angular rate, <span class="math">\(u_{7s}\)</span>, about the steer axis,
<span class="math">\(\hat{e}_3\)</span>. Another rate gyro was attached to the rear frame which
measured the body-fixed angular rate, <span class="math">\(u_{3s}\)</span>, about the axis
approximately aligned with gravity, <span class="math">\(s_\lambda\hat{c}_1 +
c_\lambda\hat{c}_3\)</span>. Finally, a third rate gyro was mounted to measure the
body fixed angular rate about a rearward pointing axis,
<span class="math">\(-c_\lambda\hat{c}_1 - s_\lambda\hat{c}_3\)</span>.<a class="footnote-reference" href="#id25" id="id19">[5]</a> The desired rates are
found from the measurments with</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-eqRates">
<span class="eqno">(1)</span>\[u_3 = u_{3s}\]\[u_4 = -u_{4s}\]\[u_7 = u_{7s} + u_{4s} \operatorname{sin}(\lambda) -
  u_{3s} \operatorname{cos}(\lambda)\]</div>
<p>We did not analyze any of the data from the rate sensors on the bicycle, but
some fruitful conclusions could be drawn such as confirming the dependence of
yaw rate on the steer and roll rates which come from the nonholonomic
constraints. Heading and wheel contact points can be estimated well for these
tasks, as the rider always tends to &#8220;zero&#8221; heading and the drift from the
sensor signal integration is quite linear, see Chapter <a class="reference internal" href="davisbicycle.html#davisbicycle"><em>Davis Instrumented Bicycle</em></a> for
details. A fairly complete kinematic state of the bicycle can be estimated,
ignoring frame pitch.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="steer-sensor-design">
<h3>Steer sensor design<a class="headerlink" href="#steer-sensor-design" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The steer sensor, a simple rotary potentiometer, was mounted with a design that
is fairly universal for different bicycle designs, <a class="reference internal" href="#figsteersensor"><em>Figure
7.14</em></a>. It offers axial adjust ability and belt tension. The
pulley diameters were chosen for +/- 45 degrees of steering angle corresponding
to about +/- 168 degrees of potentiometer angle. I originally designed it with
a cord type belt, but it was later switched to a timing belt due to our worry
about it slipping. I&#8217;m not 100% that belt slip did not occur and this could
affect the data we collected. Integrating the steer rate from the rate gyros or
differentiating the potentiometer steer angle and comparing the results to the
other sensor is a way to check. I examined one run and did not find belt slip.</p>

<h3>Data Visualization<a class="headerlink" href="#data-visualization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Our original goal was to be able to visualize the motion by watching the video
in slow motion or frame-by-frame along side a strip chart of the measured data.
This requires some way to synchronize the video data with the sensor data. The
Sony DCR-TV30E Handycam we used had a LANC output port that potentially provided an
external signal that could be sampled by the data acquisition unit but we never
quite figured it out. In the meantime though, I designed a graphical user
interface in Matlab to interact with the data, <a class="reference internal" href="#figcamgui"><em>Figure 7.15</em></a>, giving the
strip chart capabilities and video playback via the <a class="reference external" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/videoio/">videoIO</a> package developed by Gerald Dalley.
All would have worked out well, if we could have synchronized the video and
sensor data, but we abandoned it and moved on to other things. I&#8217;ve made the
source code and data available for download in case it is of use to anyone.</p>
