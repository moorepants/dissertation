<h2>Preface<a class="headerlink" href="#preface" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Attempting to derive the equations of motion of the Whipple bicycle model was
the trigger which solidified my graduate research topic. I attempted the
derivation for my class project in Mont Hubbard&#8217;s winter 2006 multi-body
dynamics class and struggled with it well into the summer before finally
getting a mostly correct answer. After the fact, I realized much of my pain was
caused by a single missing apostrophe in my Autolev source code<a class="footnote-reference" href="#apostrophe" id="id1">[1]</a>.
Luckily another student in the class, Thomas Englehardt, had also derived the
equations and helped me debug by sharing his code and going over his methods.
Even then, it turned out that my original equations weren&#8217;t &#8220;exactly&#8221; correct
and it wasn&#8217;t until Luke Peterson joined our lab and got the bicycle dynamics
itch did I get the bugs sorted out in my derivation with his help.
Conversations and collaboration with Luke have improved the derivation
significantly and influence much of what follows. Luke has also continued to
improve the derivation with the goal of printing the first compact symbolic
result. With careful parameterization and selection of generalized speeds, the
non-linear equations may be able to be put into human readable form.</p>

<h2>Non-linear Equations of Motion<a class="headerlink" href="#non-linear-equations-of-motion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Whipple Model is the foundation of all the models presented in this
dissertation. This section details derivation of the non-linear equations of
motion using Kane&#8217;s method <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#kane1985">[KL85]</a><a class="footnote-reference" href="#kane" id="id3">[2]</a>. The non-linear equations of
motion are algebraically unwieldy and no one so far has publicly printed them
in a form compact enough to print on reasonably sized paper, and certainly not
in a form suitable for any in-depth analytical understanding as pointed out in
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#meijaard2007">[MPRS07]</a>. My methodology relies heavily on computer aided algebra to do
the bookkeeping in the derivation, so I will only describe the necessary
details to correctly derive the equations, leaving the algebra, trigonometry
and calculus to the computer. The symbolic equations of motion herein were
originally developed using Autolev <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#kane2000">[KL00]</a>, a proprietary and now defunct
software package for symbolically deriving equations of motion for multi-body
systems. I&#8217;ve since used the open source software <a class="reference external" href="http://sympy.org">SymPy</a>
to derive the equations with the help of the included <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mechanics</span></tt> package
which was developed in our lab to provide a software package suitable for
academia with capabilities similar to Autolev<a class="footnote-reference" href="#autolev" id="id6">[3]</a>. The input code for
both software packages are available in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">src/eom</span></tt> directory of the

<h3>Model Description<a class="headerlink" href="#model-description" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The <em>Whipple Bicycle Model</em> <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#whipple1899">[Whi99]</a> is defined by this set of
assumptions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The model is made up of four rigid bodies: the rear frame (the main
bicycle frame which may or may not include a rigid rider), the front frame
(typically the fork and handlebar assembly), and two wheels.</li>
<li>The bodies are connected to each other by frictionless revolute joints.</li>
<li>The wheels have knife edges and contact the ground under pure rolling with no
side-slip.</li>
<li>The complete bicycle is assumed to be laterally symmetric.</li>
<li>The bicycle rolls on flat ground.</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#astrom2005">[ASKL05]</a>, <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#limebeer2006">[LS06]</a>, and <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#meijaard2007">[MPRS07]</a> all provide excellent
overviews of the model, its history, and its features.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the word &#8220;model&#8221; is often ambiguous. I will attempt to be as
precise as possible with my wording. For this chapter, I consider a dynamic
model, such as the <em>Whipple Bicycle Model</em>, to be equivalent to another
dynamic model if at least the minimal set of equations of motions are the same
(i.e. they give the same result when evaluated at a particular configuration
and state of interest). This implies that the Whipple Bicycle Model linearized
about the nominal configuration is a different model than the non-linear
<em>Whipple Bicycle Model</em>. I will try to be explicit when discussing the various
models.</p>
<p>I will use the following terminology and labels for the four rigid bodies, see
<a class="reference internal" href="#figbicyclegeometry"><em>Figure 5.2</em></a>:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Rear Frame, <span class="math">\(C\)</span></dt>

<div class="section" id="parameterization">
<span id="id11"></span><h3>Parameterization<a class="headerlink" href="#parameterization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The benchmark derivation of the linear Whipple model <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#meijaard2007">[MPRS07]</a> about the
nominal configuration uses a non-minimal set of parameters based on typical
geometric parameters and inertia definitions using an inertially fixed
reference frame in which the <span class="math">\(x\)</span> axis points forward and the <span class="math">\(z\)</span>
axis points down, <a class="reference internal" href="#figtypicalbicyclegeometry"><em>Figure 5.1</em></a>. The <em>nominal
configuration</em> is defined as the configuration when the steering angle is zero
and the bicycle is upright with respect to gravity and the ground plane. The
parameters presented in <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#meijaard2007">[MPRS07]</a> are not necessarily the best choice of
parameters, especially when looking at the model from a non-linear perspective,
as they are not the simplest set nor a minimal set. For example, the benchmark
parameters can be reduced in number by making use of gyrostats, see
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#sharp2008a">[Sha08]</a> for an implementation. Choosing a minimum, constant set of
parameters can certainly reduce the complexity of the resulting non-linear
equations. In this derivation, I use a parameterization with different geometry
and inertial definitions to facilitate a more intuitive non-linear derivation,
but do not make use of gyrostats to reduce the number of parameters.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="geometry">
<span id="id15"></span><h3>Geometry<a class="headerlink" href="#geometry" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The geometry of the Whipple model can be parameterized in an infinite number of
ways. It is typical and often natural to define the geometry with respect to
the descriptions of bicycle geometry used in the bicycle fabrication industry,
such as wheel diameter, head tube angle, trail and or rake, <a class="reference internal" href="#figtypicalbicyclegeometry"><em>Figure
5.1</em></a>. Choices of parameterizations like these create
unnecessary complications when developing the non-linear equations of motion
because they are typically defined with respect to only the nominal
configuration of the bicycle and are not constant with respect to the system
configuration.</p>

distance <span class="math">\(d_1\)</span> is the offset to the center of the rear wheel from the
steer axis and <span class="math">\(d_3\)</span> is the offset of the front wheel from the steering

along the steer axis. <a class="reference internal" href="#figbicyclegeometry"><em>Figure 5.2</em></a> gives a complete

<h3>Generalized Coordinates<a class="headerlink" href="#generalized-coordinates" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The bicycle is completely configured in a Newtonian reference frame by nine
generalized coordinates: six coordinates locate and orient the rear frame in
space and three additional coordinates are needed for the three revolute joints
connecting the front frame and wheels to the rear frame. I made use of the SAE
vehicle dynamics reference frame standard and all rotations are are defined as
positive right-handed which makes the configuration identical to that in

<h3>Holonomic Constraints<a class="headerlink" href="#holonomic-constraints" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Two holonomic configuration constraints, arising from the fact that both wheels
must touch the ground, complicate the model derivation. The first holonomic
equation is obviated by definition of the rear wheel center
<a href="#equation-eqRearWheelMassCenter">(6)</a>. This enforces that the rear wheel contact point
cannot have an displacement in the <span class="math">\(\hat{n}_3\)</span> direction<a class="footnote-reference" href="#holonomic" id="id23">[7]</a>.
The second holonomic constraint is enforced by requiring the front wheel to
touch the ground plane. The constraint is characterized by a non-linear
relationship between the roll angle <span class="math">\(q_4\)</span>, steer angle <span class="math">\(q_7\)</span> and
pitch angle <span class="math">\(q_5\)</span>.</p>

<p>In this equation, pitch, <span class="math">\(q_6\)</span>, is defined as the dependent coordinate.
The choice of pitch has to do with the fact that for &#8220;normal&#8221; bicycle
configurations, pitch is practically constant. This is not universal and it may
be smart to choose the dependent coordinate differently for other cases. The
constraint equation can actually be formulated into a quartic in the sine of
the pitch (<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#psiaki1979">[Psi79]</a>, <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#peterson2008">[PH08a]</a>) which does have an analytic, albeit
lengthy, solution. I do not opt for the analytical solution, so care is needed
when simulating and linearizing to properly choose the proper roots associated
with this dependent coordinate.</p>

<p>These five equations are linear in the eight generalized speeds. Following
convention, I choose the roll rate, <span class="math">\(u_4\)</span>, the rear wheel rate,
<span class="math">\(u_6\)</span>, and steer rate, <span class="math">\(u_7\)</span>, as independent generalized speeds.</p>
<p>Now we calculate the dependent speeds as functions of the independent speeds by
solving the linear system of equations and differentiating the resulting
equations to find the dependent <span class="math">\(\dot{u}\)</span>&#8216;s. The dependent speeds take
the form</p>

<p>At this point, the equations become analytically long and it is not necessarily
trivial to reduce the length of the equations.  A smarter choice of generalized
speeds could certainly help, but no effort was spent searching for a good set.
From this point on in the derivation, the analytical results of the equations
of motion will not be shown. I will only outline the remainder of the theory,
as all of the kinematical building blocks are in place to derive the equations
with Kane&#8217;s method (or any other method). I highly recommend the use of
computer aided algebra to continue on, but the die-hard could certainly write
them by hand.</p>

do excellent jobs describing the essential nature of both the non-linear
Whipple model and various linearized models. Notable concepts include the fact
that many of the coordinates are <em>ignorable</em>, that is they do not show up in
the essential dynamical equations of motion. These are typically the location
of the ground contact point, <span class="math">\(q_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(q_2\)</span>, the yaw angle,
<span class="math">\(q_3\)</span>, and the wheel angles, <span class="math">\(q_6\)</span> and <span class="math">\(q_8\)</span>. The model is
also energy conserving, because the contact points do no work. The model has
many equilibrium points and when linearized about the nominal configuration at
constant forward speed the open loop model (i.e. with no inputs) can exhibit
stability within various speed regimes. The system exhibits non-minimum phase
behavior and this is clearly identified in the linear models by the right half
plane zeros in various transfer functions. The previously mentioned references
are recommended for a more detailed description of the model.</p>

<h3>Non-linear Validation<a class="headerlink" href="#non-linear-validation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>It is often difficult to validate that two independently derived multibody
dynamical systems are equivalent. This due to mostly to the complexity of large
analytical expressions which can be derived by different methodologies. A
common method of validation is to evaluate the symbolic equations numerically
for non-trivial inputs and compare the results to high precision. These type of
numerical benchmarks are invaluable. They provide a baseline for model
comparison allowing for scientific reproducibility and error checking.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#basu-mandal2007">[BMCP07]</a> present the non-linear Whipple model derived with both the
Newton-Euler and Lagrange methods, along with a numerical benchmark. Table 1 in
their paper gives the derivatives of all the coordinates and speeds to high
precision for both of their derivations at a single state. They claim that if
one can compute the values to machine precision to ~10 significant figures then
the models can be concluded to be the same<a class="footnote-reference" href="#validity" id="id34">[8]</a>.</p>
<p>The Basu-Mandal et al. derivations are based on different coordinates than
those used here, but regardless of the coordinates they provide numerical
values which can be benchmarked if the correct coordinate transformations are
applied<a class="footnote-reference" href="#eqconv" id="id35">[9]</a>. In <a class="reference internal" href="#tabnonlinvalidation"><em>Table 5.1</em></a><a class="footnote-reference" href="#nonlincompare" id="id36">[11]</a>
I present the values computed from the present model in comparison to the
values presented in <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#basu-mandal2007">[BMCP07]</a>. I&#8217;ve presented the same number of
significant digits as provided by Basu-Mandall for each variable<a class="footnote-reference" href="#sigfig" id="id38">[10]</a>.
My model produces the same result to at least eleven significant figures, thus
verifying the derivation is correct.</p>

<h2>Linearized Equations of Motion<a class="headerlink" href="#linearized-equations-of-motion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The non-linear equations of motion can be linearized about various equilibrium
points. The obvious one is about the nominal configuration <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#meijaard2007">[MPRS07]</a> but
there are are an infinity of other associated with steady turns
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#basu-mandal2007">[BMCP07]</a>.  The equations can be linearized by computing the Taylor
series expansion of the non-linear equations of motion about the equilibrium
point of interest and disregarding the terms higher than first order. For the
nominal configuration, this amounts to calculating the Jacobian of the system
of equations with respect to the coordinates, speeds, and inputs to obtain the
state matrix, <span class="math">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span>, and the input matrix, <span class="math">\(\mathbf{B}\)</span>.
Output, <span class="math">\(\mathbf{C}\)</span>, and feed-forward, <span class="math">\(\mathbf{D}\)</span>,  matrices are
computed in the same fashion from the non-linear equations of the desired
outputs. The partial derivatives of each equation were evaluated at the
following fixed point: <span class="math">\(q_i=0\)</span> where <span class="math">\(i=4,5,7\)</span>, <span class="math">\(u_i=0\)</span> where
<span class="math">\(i=4,7\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(u_5=-v/r_R\)</span> where <span class="math">\(v\)</span> is the magnitude of the
component of velocity of the rear wheel center in the direction of travel. Care
has to be taken when linearizing as <span class="math">\(q_5\)</span> is a dependent coordinate which
still appears on the right hand side of the equations. In general, the chain
rule applies, but for the nominal configuration, the terms due to the implicit
definition of pitch equal zero. The linearization transforms the system into
four linear first order differential equations in the form</p>

<p>I calculate the equations symbolically to reach the same results presented in
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#meijaard2007">[MPRS07]</a>, but my equations are much lengthier because the simplification
routines available in Autolev and SymPy where not that effective.
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#meijaard2007">[MPRS07]</a> assumes linearity in their derivation from the start of the
derivation and avoids many of the simplification issues. The accuracy of the
linearized model was checked by comparing the numerical results to the
benchmark bicycle in two ways. First the linearized equations of motion,
Equation <a href="#equation-eqStateSpace">(55)</a>, were rearranged into two second order differential
equations in the canonical form (Equation <a href="#equation-eqCanonical">(56)</a>) presented in
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#meijaard2007">[MPRS07]</a>. They present the values for the coefficient matrices
(<span class="math">\(\mathbf{M}\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\mathbf{C}_1\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\mathbf{K}_0\)</span> and
<span class="math">\(\mathbf{K}_2\)</span>) for the benchmark parameter set to at least 13
significant figures and the linearization presented here matched all of the
significant figures. <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#meijaard2007">[MPRS07]</a> also provide the eigenvalues of the state
matrix at various speeds. <a class="reference internal" href="#tablincompare"><em>Table 5.2</em></a><a class="footnote-reference" href="#lincompare" id="id45">[12]</a> shows
the eigenvalues computed at 5 m/s compared to the values in Table 2 of

<p>The lateral dynamics of this linear model are remarkably similar to the
non-linear model especially around the regime of a typical bicycle&#8217;s operating
point. <a class="reference internal" href="#figlinsim"><em>Figure 5.5</em></a> gives an example simulation with the same
initial conditions as the  <a class="reference internal" href="#figfigfour"><em>Figure 5.4</em></a>. Notice that the
lateral dynamics, steer and roll, are almost identical, but that the constant
forward speed equilibrium condition destroys the conservative property
demonstrated in the non-linear model.</p>

<p>It turns out that speed has profound effect on the lateral dynamics of the
bicycle. It is useful to plot the root locus, <a class="reference internal" href="#figrootlocus"><em>Figure 5.6</em></a>,
of the characteristic equation with respect to the change in the equilibrium
forward speed to visualize the time constants, damping, frequency, and
stability of each of the modes of motion. The modes can be clearly identified
along with the speed dependent stability.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="figrootlocus">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_images/root-locus-complex.png"><img alt="_images/root-locus-complex.png" src="_images/root-locus-complex.png" style="width: 5in;" /></a>
<p class="caption">The root locus with respect to forward speed. The color variation signifies
speed as shown in the right side color bar. Two eigenvalues are real, one
being stable but increasingly fast and the other slowing to a marginally
unstable location at high speed. The other two are initially real and
unstable, but these coalesce into a complex pair and eventually become
stable, at a higher moderately well damped frequency. Generated by
<cite>src/eom/linear_comparison.py</cite>.</p>
</div>
<p>Another useful and popular way to visualize the root locus is by plotting the
real and imaginary eigenvalue components separately versus forward speed,
<a class="reference internal" href="#figeigenvalues"><em>Figure 5.7</em></a>. This view gives a clearer view of the stable
speed range.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="figeigenvalues">

<p class="caption">The real (solid) and imaginary (dashed) eigenvalue components versus speed
for an example parameter set. The four modes of motion are identified.
<em>Caster</em> is stable and real for all positive values of speed. It describes
the tendency for the front wheel to right itself in forward motion.
<em>Capsize</em> is always real and stable at low speeds but becomes marginally
unstable at a higher speed. It describes the roll of the rear frame. <em>Weave</em>
is real at very low speeds and describes an inverted pendulum-like motion
i.e. the bicycle falls over. As speed increases the eigenvalues coalesce
into a complex conjugate pair at the weave bifurcation that describes an
exponentially increasing sinusoidal motion of roll and steer, with steer
lagging the roll. This mode becomes stable at a higher speed. The weave and
capsize critical speeds bound the stable speed range. Generated by
<cite>src/eom/linear_comparison.py</cite>.</p>
</div>
<p>The behavior of the modes of motion can be visualized by plotting the
eigenvector components in the complex plane for various speeds. For the speeds
shown in the root locus plots, there are four distinct speed ranges of
interest: below the weave bifurcation, between the weave bifurcation and the
weave critical speed, the stable speed range, and above the capsize critical
speed. At a forward speed of 0.5 m/s, all eigenvalues are real, with two
unstable and two stable. In <a class="reference internal" href="#figevechalf"><em>Figure 5.8</em></a>, notice that the
unstable eigenvalues predict two modes where the roll and steer states
exponentially increase and with roll and steer 180 degrees out of phase. These
modes describes a simple unstable inverted pendulum motion.</p>

</div>
<p>For speeds above the weave bifurcation speed, this linear model exhibits three
distinct modes of motion, which have been named <em>weave</em>, <em>capsize</em>, and
<em>caster</em>. As the bicycle is brought up to a speed of 3 m/s the two unstable
eigenvalues coalesce into a complex pair. In <a class="reference internal" href="#figevechalf"><em>Figure 5.9</em></a>, the
left-most graph depicts the caster mode which simply shows a rapidly decaying
steer angle. The unstable weave mode eigenvector components show that the steer
amplitude is about 25% larger than the roll amplitude and roll angle leads the
steer angle by about 50 degrees. Finally, the capsize mode is a decays in roll
and steer, with the roll at about twice the amplitude as steer.</p>

<p>At 5 m/s all modes are stable with the weave mode showing that the roll now
only leads the steer by about 10 degrees. The caster and capsize are similar to
3 m/s.</p>

<p>The eigenvalues and eigenvectors describe the complete motion of the linear
bicycle model where the motion from each mode is sum to gather the whole motion
at a given speed. Typical diamond frame bicycle designs with an average sized
rigid rider exhibit this basic behavior, but even small variations in some of
the parameters can change the system behavior drastically, especially with
regards to stability.</p>

<h2>Parameter Conversion<a class="headerlink" href="#parameter-conversion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>

persistence and interest in minute detail helped me bring my model up to

missing apostrophe in my Autolev code, the second was that we had defined
our rear wheel rotation with respec to the <span class="math">\(B\)</span> frame instead of the
<span class="math">\(C\)</span> frame, the third was incorrect parameter conversions from the

my original code that I never found, with an entire code rewrite finally
giving me matching eigenvalues.</td></tr>
