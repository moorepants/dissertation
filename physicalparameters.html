<h2>Preface<a class="headerlink" href="#preface" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>My first concern with the physical parameters of the bicycle and rider occurred
in my multi-body dynamics class project <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#moore2006">[Moo06]</a>. There I developed a
method of estimating the parameter values using simply the geometry and mass of
the bicycle and rider. It was eventually presented as part of a paper at the
2008 ISEA conference in Biarritz, France <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#moore2008">[MH08]</a>. This method served
me well until more accurate estimates of the parameters were needed for the
first instrumented bicycle I helped build at TU Delft, see Chapter
<a class="reference internal" href="delftbicycle.html#delftbicycle"><em>Delft Instrumented Bicycle</em></a>. I signed on to the task of measuring the bike&#8217;s physical
parameters using the equipment and procedures developed in <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#kooijman2006">[Koo06]</a>
and to combine the results with my basic human model from <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#moore2008">[MH08]</a> for
the estimation of the complete system parameters of the Whipple model. These
first measurements and the details of the human model were eventually presented
in <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#moore2009a">[MKHS09]</a>. During this work, Dr. Hubbard encouraged me to think
about the accuracy of the measurements in more detail, as some of the practices
we were using were not as accurate as they could be. With that in mind and the
fact that there was very little complete data available on the physical
parameters of real bicycles, I decided to measure an assortment of bicycles we
had available around the lab in Delft <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#moore2010">[MHP+10]</a>. From this tedious task
a rich data set was created and the measurement methodology tightened up
considerably. Once I was back in Davis, we setup almost identical equipment to
measure the two new bicycles we were constructing, see Chatper
<a class="reference internal" href="davisbicycle.html#davisbicycle"><em>Davis Instrumented Bicycle</em></a>. Danique Fintelman helped us come up with a more accurate
geometry measurement. Steven Yen also used the equipment to measure a
children&#8217;s bicycle with a gyro wheel. With one last improvement, we updated
the human parameter estimates when Chris Dembia implemented Yeadon&#8217;s human
inertia model and it was combined with the accurate bicycle measurements. These
final methods for both bicycle and rider are implemented in two open source
software packages.</p>

<span id="secbicycleparameters"></span><h2>Bicycle Parameters<a class="headerlink" href="#bicycle-parameters" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Accurate measurements of a bicycle&#8217;s physical parameters are required for
realistic dynamic simulation and analysis. The most basic models require the
geometry, mass, mass location, and mass distributions for the rigid bodies.
More complex models require estimates of tire characteristics, human body
segment inertial characteristics, friction, stiffness, damping, etc. In this
chapter I present the measurement of the minimal bicycle/rider parameters
required for the benchmark Whipple bicycle model presented in
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#meijaard2007">[MPRS07]</a>. This model is composed of four rigid bodies, has ideal
rolling and frictionless joints, and is laterally symmetric. A set of 25
parameters describes the geometry, mass, mass location and mass distribution of
each of the rigid bodies. The experimental methods used to estimate the
parameters described herein are based primarily on the work done in
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#kooijman2006">[Koo06]</a>, <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#kooijman2008">[KSM08]</a> and <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#moore2009a">[MKHS09]</a> but have been
refined for improved accuracy and methodology.</p>
<p>Koojiman&#8217;s work was preceded by that of several others. Roland and Massing
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#roland1971">[RM71]</a> measured the physical parameters of a bicycle in much the
same way as is presented, including calculations of uncertainty from the
indirect measurement techniques. <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#zytveld1975">[VZ75]</a> measured the inertial
parameters of his robotic bicycle with a swing pendulum and a stop watch.
Patterson <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#patterson2004">[Pat04b]</a> used a swing to measure the roll inertia of
recumbent bicycles with a rider. <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#connors2009">[Con09]</a> and <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#stevens2009">[Ste09]</a>
used a computer aided design package to estimate the parameters.
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#escalona2010">[ER10]</a> measured a bicycle for his bicycle dynamics class in
Spain. Also, some notable motorcycle and scooter measurements include
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#dohring1953">[Doh53]</a>, <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#dohring1955">[Doh55]</a>, <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#singh1971">[SG71]</a>, <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#eaton1973">[Eat73b]</a>,
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#roland1973">[RR73]</a>, and <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#sharp1997b">[Sha97]</a>.</p>
<p>Here is documented the indirect measurement of ten real bicycles&#8217; physical
parameters. We improve upon previous methods by both increasing and reporting
the accuracies of the measurements and by measuring the complete moments of
inertia of the laterally symmetric frame and fork needed for analysis of the
nonlinear model. Furthermore, very little data exists on the physical
parameters of different types of bicycles and this work aims to provide a small
sample of bicycles.</p>
<p>We measured the physical characteristics of eleven different bicycles, three of
which were set up in two different configurations. The first six bicycles,
chosen for both variety and convenience, are as follows: <em>Batavus Browser</em>, a
Dutch style city bicycle measured with and without instrumentation as described
in <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#kooijman2009a">[KSM09]</a>; <em>Batavus Stratos Deluxe</em>, a Dutch style sporty city
bicycle; <em>Batavus Crescendo Deluxe</em> a Dutch style city bicycle with a suspended
fork; <em>Gary Fisher Mountain Bike</em>, a hard-tail mountain bicycle; <em>Bianchi
Pista</em>, a modern steel frame track racing bicycle; and <em>Yellow Bicycle</em>, a
stripped down aluminum frame road bicycle measured in two configurations, the
second with the fork rotated in the head tube 180 degrees for larger trail. The
last two bicycles were measured in Davis: the instrumented bicycle presented in
chapter <a class="reference internal" href="davisbicycle.html#davisbicycle"><em>Davis Instrumented Bicycle</em></a> and a children&#8217;s bicycle with a stabilizing
flywheel called the GyroBike.</p>
<p>These eleven different parameter sets can be used with, but are not limited to,
the benchmark bicycle model. The accuracy of all the measurements are
presented. The accuracies are based measurement inaccuracies and the proper use
of error propagation theory with correlations taken into account.</p>
<div class="section" id="parameters">
<span id="secparameters"></span><h3>Parameters<a class="headerlink" href="#parameters" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Of primarily concern was measuring and estimating the 25 parameters associated
with the benchmark Whipple bicycle model which is derived and described in
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#meijaard2007">[MPRS07]</a>. The unforced two degree-of-freedom, <span class="math">\(\mathbf{q} =
[\delta \quad \phi]^T\)</span> model takes the form:</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-eqCanonical">
<span class="eqno">(1)</span>\[\mathbf{M\ddot{q}}
+v\mathbf{C}_1\mathbf{\dot{q}}
+\left[g\mathbf{K}_0
+v^2\mathbf{K}_2\right]\mathbf{q}
=0\]</div>
<p>where the entries of the <span class="math">\(\mathbf{M}\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\mathbf{C}_1\)</span>,
<span class="math">\(\mathbf{K}_0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\mathbf{K}_2\)</span> matrices are combinations of 25
bicycle physical parameters that include the geometry, mass, mass location and
mass distribution of the four rigid bodies. The 25 parameters presented in
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#meijaard2007">[MPRS07]</a> are not necessarily a minimum set for the Whipple model,
as shown in <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#sharp2008a">[Sha08]</a>, but are useful none-the-less as they represent
intuitively measurable quantities and have become become standard due to the
nature of the benchmark. They are also not parameters used in directly in the
derivation in Chapter <a class="reference internal" href="eom.html#eom"><em>Bicycle Equations Of Motion</em></a> but can easily be converted, as was shown. The
25 parameters can be measured using many techniques. In general, I attempted to
measure the benchmark parameter as directly as possible to improve the
accuracy.</p>

<h3>Bicycle Descriptions<a class="headerlink" href="#bicycle-descriptions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We measured a total of eight bicycles in eleven configurations, <a class="reference internal" href="#figbicycles"><em>Figure
7.1</em></a>. The three Batavus bicycles were donated by the manufacturer.
We asked for a bicycle that they considered stable and one that they did not.
They offered the Browser as a &#8220;stable&#8221; bicycle and the Stratos as &#8220;nervous&#8221;.
The Crescendo was considered average handling. We measured an instrumented
version of the Browser that was used in the experiments described in Chapter
<a class="reference internal" href="delftbicycle.html#delftbicycle"><em>Delft Instrumented Bicycle</em></a>. The Fisher and the Pista were chosen to provide some
variety, a mountain and road bike. The yellow bike is used to demonstrate
bicycle stability and the forked is reversed to provide better stability when
perturbed with no rider. The Davis instrumented bicycle is an instrumented
bicycle described in Chapter <a class="reference internal" href="davisbicycle.html#davisbicycle"><em>Davis Instrumented Bicycle</em></a> and we measured the frame in
configurations for different rider seating positions. The child&#8217;s bicycle has
the GyroWheel product installed in the front wheel. The first six of these
bicycles were measured in Delft and will hereafter be referred to as the <em>Delft
Bicycles</em>. The remaining two bicycles were measure in Davis and will be
referred to as the <em>Davis Bicycles</em>.</p>

<div class="section" id="accuracy">
<span id="secaccuracy"></span><h3>Accuracy<a class="headerlink" href="#accuracy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We here analyze the accuracy of the measurements of the parameters. Following
the lead of <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#roland1971">[RM71]</a> error propagation theory was used to calculate
accuracy of the 25 benchmark parameters. This begins by estimating the standard
deviation of the actual measurements taken, see Section
<a class="reference internal" href="#secbicyclemeasuredparameters"><em>Bicycle Measured Parameters</em></a>. The measurement error was chosen based on
the measuring tool and methods used. If <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is a parameter and is a
function of the measurements, <span class="math">\(u,v,\ldots\)</span>, which are Gaussian random
variables then <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is also a Gaussian random variable defined as
<span class="math">\(x=f(u,v,\ldots)\)</span>. The sample variance of <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is defined as</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-sampleVariance">
<span class="eqno">(2)</span>\[s_x^2 =
\frac{1}{N-1}\sum^N_{i=1}
\left[(u_i - \bar{u})^2\left(\frac{\partial x}{\partial u}\right)^2 +
(v_i - \bar{v})^2\left(\frac{\partial x}{\partial v}\right)^2 +
2(u_i - \bar{u})(v_i - \bar{v})\left(\frac{\partial x}{\partial u}\right)
\left(\frac{\partial x}{\partial v}\right)
+ \ldots\right]\]</div>
<p>Using the definitions for variance and covariance, Equation
<a href="#equation-sampleVariance">(2)</a> can be simplified to</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-variance">
<span class="eqno">(3)</span>\[s_x^2 = s_u^2\left(\frac{\partial x}{\partial u}\right)^2 +
        s_v^2\left(\frac{\partial x}{\partial v}\right)^2 +
        2s_{uv}\left(\frac{\partial x}{\partial u}\right)
        \left(\frac{\partial x}{\partial v}\right)
        + \ldots\]</div>
<p>If <span class="math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math">\(v\)</span> are uncorrelated then <span class="math">\(s_{uv}=0\)</span>. Most of the
calculations hereafter have uncorrelated variables but a few do not and the
covariance has to be taken into account. Equation <a href="#equation-variance">(3)</a> can be used to
calculate the variance of all types of functions. I made use of the Python
package <a class="reference external" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/uncertainties/">uncertainties</a>
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#lebigot2010">[Leb10]</a> to simplify the book keeping of the correlations and
variance calculations, thus some of the equations for the error are not shown
in the following sections.</p>

<div class="section" id="geometry">
<span id="secgeometry"></span><h3>Geometry<a class="headerlink" href="#geometry" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The geometry measurements of the Delft bicycles focused on measuring the
benchmark parameters: trail, wheelbase, and steer axis tilt as directly as
possible. I also present an alternative method for the geometry used with the
Davis bicycles that attempts to measure the distances in my model derivation,
Chapter <a class="reference internal" href="eom.html#eom"><em>Bicycle Equations Of Motion</em></a>, which improves the accuracy of the parameters. Keep in
mind, that I assumed that the frame did not flex and that the wheel radii do
not change with rider weight when taking geometric measurements.</p>
<div class="section" id="wheel-radii">
<span id="secwheelradii"></span><h4>Wheel Radii<a class="headerlink" href="#wheel-radii" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The radii of the front <span class="math">\(r_\mathrm{F}\)</span> and rear <span class="math">\(r_\mathrm{R}\)</span>
wheels were estimated by measuring the linear distance traversed along the
ground through at least ten rotations of the wheel. Each wheel traversal was
measured separately and the measurements were taken with rider seated on the
bicycle, except for the gyro bicycle which had no rider. A 72 kg rider sat on
the Delft bicycles and an 84 kg rider on the Davis instrumented bicycle
<a class="footnote-reference" href="#weight" id="id29">[1]</a>. A 30 meter tape measure (resolution: 2mm) was pulled tight and
taped on a flat level smooth floor for the Delft bicycles and for the Davis
bicycles we marked a 68 foot length on the floor and used a 1/16 inch
resolution ruler to measure the 6 to 15 inch distance past the 68 foot mark
where the rotation stopped. The tire was marked and aligned with the tape
measure <a class="reference internal" href="#figtirechalk"><em>Figure 7.2</em></a>. The accuracy of the distance
measurement is approximately <span class="math">\(\pm0.01\)</span> meter. The tires were pumped to
the recommended inflation pressure before the measurements. The wheel radius is
calculated by</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-wheelRadius">

standard deviation of the subscripted variable. I use subscripts <span class="math">\(F\)</span> and

<p>For the Delft Bicycles, the head tube angle was measured directly using an
electronic level, <a class="reference internal" href="#figheadtube"><em>Figure 7.3</em></a>. The bicycle frame was fixed
perpendicular to the ground, the steering angle was set to the nominal
position, tire pressures were at recommended levels, and the bicycle was
unloaded. The steer axis tilt <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span> is the complement to the head

<p>The idealized trail is difficult to measure directly due to the fact that the
tire has a contact patch and there is no distinct contact point. Instead I
chose to measure the fork offset, <span class="math">\(f_o\)</span>, and compute the ideal trail. The
fork offset was measured by clamping the steer tube of the front fork into a
v-block on a flat table, <a class="reference internal" href="#figforkoffset"><em>Figure 7.4</em></a>. For the Delft
bicycles, a ruler was used to measure the height of the center of the head tube
and the height of the center of the axle axis, and for the Davis bicycles we
made use of more accurate height gages. The fork blades were aligned such that
the axle axis was parallel to the table surface.</p>

<h3>Alternative Geometry Measurement Method<a class="headerlink" href="#alternative-geometry-measurement-method" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The geometry for the bicycle model presented in Chapter:<cite>eom</cite> can almost be
measured directly. I used this method for the Davis Bicycles. The bicycle frame
is set on a granite measurement table such that the head tube is in a v-block
and parallel to the table surface and the bicycle frame is situated such that
the frame is perpendicular to the table surface, <a class="reference internal" href="#figalternativegeometry"><em>Figure 5</em></a>. The fork is rotated in the head tube such that the
fork blades curve upwards. Two dummy axles are fit into the front and rear
dropouts and the axles are ensured to be parallel to the table surface. The
height from the table surface to the top of each axle are recorded with a
height gage and the diameters of the axles are measured with a micrometer or
caliper.</p>

<p>These measurements can then be converted to the three essential bicycle

<p>The physical phenomenon observed corresponding to data sets such as these
occurred when the bicycle frame or fork was perturbed torsionally. After being set
into motion, the torsional motion damped and a longitudinal swinging motion
increased. The motions alternated back and forth with neither ever reaching
zero. The frequencies of these motions were very close to one another and it
was not apparent how to dissect the two. We explored fitting to a function such as</p>

similar frequencies. There was no easy way to choose which of the two
<span class="math">\(\omega\)</span>&#8216;s was the one associated with the torsional oscillation. Some
work was done to model the torsional pendulum as a laterally flexible beam to
determine this, but we ended up assuming that the accuracy of the period
calculation would not improve enough for the effort required. The later
experiments simply prevented the swinging motion of the pendulum without
damping the torsional motion.</p>

<h4>Frame<a class="headerlink" href="#frame" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>At least three measurements were made to estimate the locally level moments and
products of inertia (<span class="math">\(I_{\mathrm{B}xx}\)</span>, <span class="math">\(I_{\mathrm{B}xz}\)</span>, and
<span class="math">\(I_{\mathrm{B}zz}\)</span>) of the rear frame in the nominal configuration. The
rear frame was typically hung from either the three main tubes (seat tube, down
tube, and top tube), the seat post, or a small fixture mounted to the brake
mounts <a class="reference internal" href="#figpendulumangle"><em>Figure 7.8</em></a>. The rear fender prevented easy
connection to the seat tube on some of the bikes and the clamp was attached to
the fender. The fender was less rigid than the frame tube. For best accuracy
with only three orientation angles, the frame should be hung at three angles
that are <span class="math">\(120^\circ\)</span> apart. Attaching by the three tubes on the frame
generally provide that the orientation angles were spread evenly at about
<span class="math">\(120^\circ\)</span>. Furthermore, taking data at more orientation angles improved
the accuracy and was generally possible with standard diamond frame bicycles.</p>
<p>Three moments of inertia <span class="math">\(J_{\mathrm{B}i}\)</span> about the pendulum axes were
calculated using</p>

<p>The moments and products of inertia of the rear frame and handlebar/fork
assembly with reference to the benchmark coordinate system were calculated by
formulating the relationship between the rotated inertial frames</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-eqRotIn">
<span class="eqno">(33)</span>\[\mathbf{J}_{\mathrm{B}i} = \mathbf{R}_i \mathbf{I}_\mathrm{B} \mathbf{R}_i^T\]</div>

locally level reference frame, and <span class="math">\(\mathbf{R}_{\mathrm{B}i}\)</span> is the
rotation matrix relating the two frames, <a class="reference internal" href="#figangles"><em>Figure 7.7</em></a>. The
planar inertia tensor is defined as</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-eqMoI">

<p>The inertia tensor can be reduced to a <span class="math">\(2 \times 2\)</span> matrix because the
frame is assumed to be laterally symmetric and the <span class="math">\(Y\)</span> axis of the
pendulum reference is the same as the <span class="math">\(Y\)</span> axis of the benchmark reference

reduced to a <span class="math">\(2 \times 2\)</span> matrix where <span class="math">\(s_{\beta i}\)</span> and
<span class="math">\(c_{\beta i}\)</span> are defined as <span class="math">\(\sin{\beta_i}\)</span> and
<span class="math">\(\cos{\beta_i}\)</span>, respectively.</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-eqRotMat">
<span class="eqno">(35)</span>\[\begin{split}\mathbf{R}=
\begin{bmatrix}

<p>The first entry of <span class="math">\(\mathbf{J}_{\mathrm{B}i}\)</span> in Equation <a href="#equation-eqRotIn">(33)</a>

s^{2}_{\beta i}I_{\mathrm{B}zz}\]</div>
<p>Similarly, calculating all three, or more, <span class="math">\(J_{\mathrm{B}i}\)</span> allows one
to form</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-eqInRel">

<p>and the moments of inertia can be solved as a linear system or with least
squares if it is over determined. The inertia of the frame about an axis normal

<p>The inertia of the fork and handlebar is calculated in the same way as the

least three equally spaced orientation angles, especially if there is no
fender. We designed a connection to the brake mounts for the Davis bicycles to
remedy that. The torsional calculations follow equations <a href="#equation-eqTorPend">(32)</a>

<h2>Human Parameters<a class="headerlink" href="#human-parameters" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To properly model the bicycle rider system it is necessary to estimate the
physical parameters of the bicycle rider. The measurement of the physical
properties of a human is more difficult than for a bicycle because the human
body parts are not as easily described as rigid bodes with defined joints and
due to flexible geometry, daily varying mass, wobbly mass, etc.</p>
<p>Human mass, center of mass, and inertial properties have been measured and
estimated in a multitude of ways. Each method has its advantages and
disadvantages. Many methods exist including cadaver measurements
(<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#dempster1955">[Dem55]</a>, <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#clauser1969">[CMY69]</a>, <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#chandler1975">[CCM+75]</a>),
photogrammetry, ray scanning techniques (<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#zatsiorsky1983">[ZS83]</a>,
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#zatsiorsky1990">[ZSC90]</a>), water displacement (<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#park1999">[PKP99]</a>), rotating
platforms (<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#griffiths2005">[GWS05]</a>), and geometrical estimation of the body
segments (<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#yeadon1990a">[Yea90a]</a>). <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#dohring1953">[Doh53]</a>, <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#eaton1973">[Eat73b]</a>, and
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#patterson2004">[Pat04b]</a> measured the moments of inertia and centers of mass of a
combined rider and vehicle, but this is not always practical especially if the
properties of multiple riders are desired.</p>
<p>I approached the human parameter estimation in a more analytical fashion based
primarily on geometric measurements much like Yeadon. Both methods that were
used were based on estimating the inertial parameters from mass and geometry
measurement along with a human body density estimate. With the first method, I
estimated the physical properties of the rider in a seated position using a
simple mathematical geometrical estimation similar in idea to
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#yeadon1990a">[Yea90a]</a> in combination with mass data from <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#dempster1955">[Dem55]</a>.
The second method substitutes Yeadon&#8217;s more robust model with my previous one.</p>
<div class="section" id="simple-geometry-method">
<h3>Simple Geometry Method<a class="headerlink" href="#simple-geometry-method" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This method calculates the center of mass and inertia of a simplified model of
the ten major human body parts: head, torso, upper and lower arms, and upper
and lower legs, in a general configuration for sitting on typical bicycles. The
mass of the rider was measured along with fourteen anthropometric measurements
of the body. These measurements in combination with the geometrical bicycle
measurements taken in the previous section (<a class="reference internal" href="#secbicycleparameters"><em>Bicycle Parameters</em></a>) and
several additional bicycle geometrical measurements are used to define a model
of the rider made up of simple geometrical shapes (<a class="reference internal" href="#figmooremodel"><em>Figure
7.22</em></a>). The legs and arms are represented by cylinders, the
torso by a cuboid and the head by a sphere. The feet are positioned at the
center of the bottom bracket axis to maintain symmetry about the
<span class="math">\(XZ\)</span>-plane.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="figmooremodel">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_images/moore-model.png"><img alt="_images/moore-model.png" src="_images/moore-model.png" style="width: 2.5in;" /></a>
<p class="caption">Locations of grid points and simple geometric shapes of the simple geometric
inertia model.</p>
</div>
<p>All but one of the anthropomorphic measurements are taken when the rider was
standing casually on flat ground. The lower leg length <span class="math">\(l_{ll}\)</span> is the
distance from the floor to the knee joint. The upper leg length <span class="math">\(l_{ul}\)</span>
is the distance from the knee joint to the hip joint. The length from hip to
hip <span class="math">\(l_{hh}\)</span> and shoulder to shoulder <span class="math">\(l_{ss}\)</span> are the distances
between the two hip joints and two shoulder joints, respectively. The torso
length <span class="math">\(l_{to}\)</span> is the distance between hip joints and shoulder joints.
The upper arm length <span class="math">\(l_{ua}\)</span> is the distance between the shoulder and
elbow joints. The lower arm length <span class="math">\(l_{al}\)</span> is the distance from the
elbow joint to the center of the hand when the arm is outstretched. The
circumferences are taken at the cross section of maximum circumference (e.g.
around the bicep, around the brow, over the nipples for the chest). The final
dimension is taken while the rider is seated on the bicycle in a normal riding
position. The forward lean angle <span class="math">\(\lambda_{fl}\)</span> is the approximate angle
made between the floor (<span class="math">\(XY\)</span>-plane) and the line connecting the center of
the rider&#8217;s head and the top of the seat. This was estimated by taking a side
profile photograph of the rider on the bicycle and scribing a line from the
center of the head to the top of the seat. The measurements were made as
accurately as possible with basic tools but no special attention is given
further to the accuracy of the calculations due to the fact that modeling the
human as basic geometric shapes already introduces an unknown error.</p>
<p>I measured twelve additional geometric values (only five of which are needed
for this setup<a class="footnote-reference" href="#f1" id="id58">[8]</a>) to assist in configuring the rider to the be seated on
the bicycle, <a class="reference internal" href="#figbatavusbrowserdim"><em>Figure 7.23</em></a>.</p>

thirty one grid points in three dimensional space that map the skeleton of the

<h3>Yeadon method<a class="headerlink" href="#yeadon-method" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#yeadon1990a">[Yea90a]</a> human inertial model was developed for estimating the
inertial parameters needed to describe a human model for complex gymnastic
maneuvers. It is essentially a more complete and accurate method than the one
previously presented. There are 95 geometrical measurements of the human and a
single mass measurement for scaling the body part densities. Yeadon makes use
of stadium solids and a single semi-ellipse to more accurately model the human
geometry. Two apparent deficiencies are the fact that too much detail is taken
for body parts that have less inertia (i.e. the hands/feet) and at large
configuration angles for some joints, the inertia is poorly modeled (e.g. the
buttocks disappears when the human in a seated position). The model also does not
have full freedom at each joint. Refer to <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#yeadon1990a">[Yea90a]</a> for a complete
description of the model.</p>
<p>Once the inertia of each segment in the Yeadon model is computed, the joint
angles must be set. We set the somersault angle to match the forward lean angle
as described in the previous section. We then measure three additional bicycle
dimensions to assist in the configuration of the rider. They are as follows:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><span class="math">\(w_{hb}\)</span>, Handlebar width</dt>
<dd>The lateral distance between the points the hands hold the handlebars.</dd>
<dt><span class="math">\(l_{hbR}\)</span>, Rear hub to handlebar.</dt>
<dd>The distance from the center of the rear hub to the point on the handlebar
where the hand grips.</dd>
<dt><span class="math">\(l_{hbF}\)</span>, Front hub to handlebar.</dt>
<dd>The distance from the center of the front hub to the point on the handlebar
where the hand grips.</dd>
</dl>
<p>We locate the hip center (Ls0) at the top of the bicycle seat and the
somersault joint angle is set such that the torso (P, T, C) aligned by the
forward lean angle <span class="math">\(\lambda_{fl}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The basic process for setting the elbow elevation angle is to find the distance
between the shoulder (La0, Lb0) and the handlebar grip. The handlebar grip
location is at the point at which the lateral line with length
<span class="math">\(\frac{w_{hb}}{2}\)</span> intersects the circle formed by the intersection of
the two spheres which are centered at the front and rear wheel centers with
radii <span class="math">\(l_{hbF}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(l_{hbR}\)</span>, respectively. The elevation angle of
the elbow then is defined as the angle at which the distance from the shoulder
(La0, Lb0) to the knuckle (La6, Lb6) is equal to the distance from the shoulder
(La0, Lb0) to the handlebar grip. We then assume that the shoulder rotation
angle is zero and find the shoulder elevation and abduction angles which force
the vector from the shoulder to the knuckle to equal the vector from the
shoulder to the handlebar grip.</p>
<p>The thigh and knee elevation angles are set such that the center of the heel
level (Lj6, Lk6) is aligned with the bottom bracket axis and that both the
thigh abduction and rotation angles are zero. We assume that the foot peg is
located at the bottom bracket center and is the same lateral distance from the
sagittal plane as the hip centers. The knee and thigh elevation angles are then
found in the same fashion as the elbow and shoulder angles, which the lesser
restriction that the thigh abduction angle is zero.</p>

<h2>Bicycle-Rider Parameters<a class="headerlink" href="#bicycle-rider-parameters" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Once both the bicycle and rider parameters are known, the parameter for various
systems can be extracted. The simplest is that the rider is rigidly attached to
the frame. The parallel axis theorem allows one to calculate the combined
inertia of the bicycle frame and the rigid rider. Both of the rider
formulations also allow one to segment the body for more complex rider models
with multiple degrees of freedom. For example, the inertia for a leaning
rider&#8217;s upper body can be determined separately and the legs can be fixed in
the bicycle frame. We make use of this for the different rider biomechanical
models presented in Chapter <a class="reference internal" href="extensions.html#extensions"><em>Extensions of the Whipple Model</em></a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="software-implementation">
<h2>Software Implementation<a class="headerlink" href="#software-implementation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The bicycle parameter calculation and the Yeadon method have been implemented
in two open source software packages written in the Python language, called
<a class="reference external" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/yeadon">yeadon</a> <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#dembia2011">[Dem11]</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/BicycleParameters">BicycleParameters</a>
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#moore2011a">[Moo11]</a>. The Yeadon package uses geometric measurements and joint
configuration angles to output the total inertia properties of the human in an
arbitrary reference frame. It also can provide inertial properties of
individual body segments or combinations of body segments. It is suitable for a
wide variety of human dynamic models. The BicycleParameters package accepts
either the raw measurements described in Section <a class="reference internal" href="#secbicycleparameters"><em>Bicycle Parameters</em></a> or
the benchmark parameterization <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#meijaard2007">[MPRS07]</a> and computes the benchmark
bicycle parameters. It makes use of the Yeadon package to allow one to
configure riders in a seated position on the bicycle and outputs the inertial
properties of the bicycle/rider system. Overall it allows one to provide values
and uncertainties for all of the raw measurements as described in both the
Bicycle and Yeadon parameter sections and compute the parameters for the
Whipple Bicycle model. Details of use of the software can be found in the
documentation for each of the packages: <a class="reference external" href="http://packages.python.org/yeadon">http://packages.python.org/yeadon</a>,
