<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The typical conversation with someone I&#8217;ve met over the past years that I&#8217;ve
been a graduate student inevitably comes to this: &#8220;So what do you do in
graduate school?&#8221;. My reply is &#8220;I study how people balance on bicycles&#8221;. This
is a great conversation starter as almost everyone recalls learning how to ride
a bicycle. It is something we weren&#8217;t born to do and we almost always remember
the feeling of learning the skill. It is typically quite a momentous occasion
in most folks&#8217; lives. Usually everyone thinks the research is cool and can
identify with it, but the next question (as with most research), is &#8220;What
application is that good for?&#8221;. As an engineer, we are trained to be
application minded. It is certainly what drove me to start down this path in
the first place. There is an answer to this second question, but over the years
I&#8217;ve gotten less enthusiastic about trying to justify why I&#8217;m working on this
project with respect to an immediate application. In many ways this is simply
the reality for the growing scientist. It becomes obvious that basic science
simply needs to be performed, without regard to what it may or may
not accomplish. The benefits down the road are inevitable and there is a large
body of evidence to support that. But nonetheless my initial curiosity about bicycle
dynamics is rooted in application and it still is in many ways. But I&#8217;m content
with understanding difficult problems for basic progression in learning and
science.</p>
<p>My first inquiries about bicycle dynamics came from my attempts to design a
recumbent bicycle frame for my senior design project at Old Dominion
University. Recumbents are notorious for not being that easy to ride and we
were building one for the annual ASME Human Powered Vehicle challenge which
would be especially unusual with an extremely low center of gravity. It needed
to be suitable for novice riders to control. I found myself in the design
process where one needs to choose the wheel sizes, front end geometry and
location and seating position of the rider. As a young engineer is taught, I
went looking for technical guidelines to choose these parameters for our
bicycle design. But all I came back with were many conflicting ideas from
various bicycle fabricators and the book Bicycling Science 2nd Ed <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#whitt1982">[WW82]</a>
which gave a synopsis of Jones&#8217; <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#jones1970">[Jon70]</a> conclusions from his famous study
on the stability of bicycles. I studied this in detail and designed my bicycle
geometry to be exactly what was specified as good handling by Jones.<a class="footnote-reference" href="#tubes" id="id3">[1]</a>
The bicycle turned out to be rideable (after lots of practice), but this was
probably the first time I realized in my engineering career that there isn&#8217;t a
formula for everything.</p>
<p>These particulars fell onto the back burner as I finished my work at the
Langley Full Scale Tunnel and did not re-emerge until a few classes at UC Davis
brought these concepts back into my picture. In particular, I attempted to
derive the equations of motion of the bicycle in Mont Hubbard&#8217;s multi-body
dynamics class at the beginning of 2006 and the power to potentially properly
answer the questions I had back at Old Dominion seemed to be at my finger tips.
Little did I realize that those answers simply introduced more difficult
questions and a research project was born.</p>
<p>This dissertation documents most of the work I&#8217;ve done and my thoughts on
bicycle dynamics, control, and handling at UC Davis and TU Delft since around
December 2006.</p>

<div class="section" id="reproducibility">
<h2>Reproducibility<a class="headerlink" href="#reproducibility" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Over the past few years, I&#8217;ve begun realize how reproducibility is crucial for
science to improve and grow rapidly, all the while building a deeply intact and
strong foundation for future researchers and that it may not be as reproducible
as we may all think. With that in mind, I have put a great deal of effort into
making my work more accessible, reusable, and ultimately reproducible, which is
the cornerstone of all scientific understanding. For the type of work presented
here, the majority is computational and the computer along with software have
enabled our generation to make the work reproducible without too much extra
effort. My intention is provide enough information in the form of data, source
code, and writing, that others will have a <em>relatively</em> easy time reproducing
my work. This has been mostly possible in the time frame that I&#8217;ve had to
complete the thesis, but there are some holes in particular with respect to the
work done in the earlier years of the project.</p>
<div class="section" id="literature">
<h3>Literature<a class="headerlink" href="#literature" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>I really enjoy reading older dissertations and technical reports because they
typically have so much detail, much more than any journal paper will ever have.
I find these details to be invaluable for developing new research plans and
understanding. This is especially true when the null science is reported, which
gives a much better idea of what not to do. My dissertation is modeled after
these longer documents and I&#8217;ve attempted to include as much detail in the
decision making processes, methods, and results as possible.</p>
<p>This dissertation is partly original work that has not been published in any
form and partly based on several journal and conference papers that I have
written or co-authored over the years. I&#8217;ve given an outline below of the
papers which have been subsumed into this thesis.</p>

<h3>Source Code<a class="headerlink" href="#source-code" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>It is very possible to code every computation that an engineer does and in many
ways the most preferable method to record it. It is not only a record of the
working computation that contains all of the details needed but an executable
source that can be reused. But this doesn&#8217;t mean one can simply drop all of
their undocumented scripts into a folder, publish it to the web and expect
anyone to ever be able to decipher it and actually use it. It takes much more
effort to document the source code and to put it into a usable form. These
techniques are very rarely, if at all, taught to engineers. Once I got a
taste of the development methods of software engineers and computer scientists
I couldn&#8217;t believe how poorly we engineers execute our code. Not only does
creating usable and well documented code help others to use it, but it helps
you to know what it is and be able to reuse it yourself. It is documented proof
of working methods. I have no idea how much code &#8220;waste&#8221; is on my hard drive
that I will never have the time to decipher again and make use of it.</p>
<p>I have several layers of code that supports this document. In general, all of
the figures and tables are generated by scripts in the <cite>src</cite> directory included
with the source to this dissertation. These scripts access a variety packages
in my software stack with most of them being open source packages that I or
some of my collaborators have written. The following gives a list of the

<h2>Dissertation website<a class="headerlink" href="#dissertation-website" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I decided to publish my dissertation publicly on the internet from the day I
started writing it. The first reason for this is that I want to take full
advantage of the ability the web offers for conveying ideas and information,
whether it be a video or an interactive program. Paper-based publication is a
thing of the past and is an unbelievably limited form of sharing, especially in
science. Secondly, I want the process of writing my dissertation to be in the
open with the ability for anyone to offer comments, suggestions and edits.
Dissertations are traditionally considered to be the work of a single
individual, but that is never true. All the research we do as scientists is
built upon the works of others and rarely does anyone produce their work
without the help of others. Dissertations in the USA are typically very
individualistically oriented but I&#8217;ve begun to believe that we should strive to
move away from the idea that some work is only due to one person and embrace
the fact that we need help from many people to complete something like a
dissertation for a doctoral degree. So it is best to be collaborative from the
beginning with a sufficient mechanism to provide credit where credit is due. I
also want this work to be the best it can be, and if others are interested in
helping me make it that way then an interactive website is a platform that is
capable of promoting this.</p>
<p>I desired to follow these basic rules when writing my dissertation:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The content should be written presentation format neutral.</li>
<li>The primary presentation view is through a web browser, but a static PDF
version is also available to suit UCD&#8217;s archaic submission rules.</li>
<li>The source code for all the figures, animations, and interactive bits should
be included with the dissertation.</li>
<li>The experimentally collected data should all be available for download and
use by others.</li>
<li>Software tools should be developed if at all possible, instead of
disconnected scripts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on these goals, I choose the <a class="reference external" href="http://sphinx.pocoo.org/">Sphinx</a>
publishing platform for my dissertation. The text source, which is written in
reStructuredText, is available along with the source code for the figures at
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/moorepants/dissertation">https://github.com/moorepants/dissertation</a>. The HTML version can be viewed

<h2>Writing Style<a class="headerlink" href="#writing-style" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I generally find scientific writing in my field to be extremely dry. We&#8217;ve
developed a collective style that removes any material that isn&#8217;t technical
from the articles and this in turn causes us to gloss over the fact that people
are behind all of the reported research. These people have ideas, struggles,
mishaps, revelations, and sometimes even fun. But these things weren&#8217;t always
hidden. Early engineering articles ended with lengthy personal conversations
between the reviewers and the authors (<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#wilson-jones1951">[Wil51]</a>,
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#kondo1955">[Kon55]</a>) and include much more artistic and beautiful illustrations.
Page limits in journal and conference articles force today&#8217;s writer to make
their writing as dry as possible to maximize the amount of technical content.
I&#8217;m no writing ace, but have decided to inject some of the humanism that comes
along with a project than spans seven years of ones life into this text. I
mostly corralled these ramblings in the prefaces and footnotes of the chapters,
but some has sneaked into the drier areas too. I hope that these asides give
some idea of how all of this work developed and who to attribute the ideas and
labor to along with breaking up the monotony of the technical parts of the
text. I figured that a dissertation will be one of the few writings in my
career that provides a chance to do this.</p>

<h2>Attribution<a class="headerlink" href="#attribution" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As a child, I was programmed to think that any form of plagiarism was evil: you
shouldn&#8217;t copy anything. But how would we ever make any progress if we didn&#8217;t
copy and improve on what others have done in the past? The work presented here
is mostly based on the work that I have done in the past several years, but
there are many other people&#8217;s work that is wrapped up in it. Their
writings and thoughts will inevitably be present in this text. I do not claim
these as my own, but they will be required to tell the story of the research. I
will do my best to acknowledge everyone&#8217;s work in this thesis, but there will
surely be some that I have forgotten. Please let me know if that is so, and I
will remedy it.</p>

<h2>Notation<a class="headerlink" href="#notation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I attempt to keep notation consistent throughout each chapter, with much of the
notation being consistent throughout the dissertation. The extensions chapter
has different notation for each model. The notation for the Chapter is given at
the end of each Chapter. There are ultimately two notations forms for the
bicycle: mine which follows a Kane-like syntax and the one adapted from
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#meijaard2007">[MPRS07]</a>.</p>
